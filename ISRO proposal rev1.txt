1 Introduction 
The Birla Institute of Technology & Science, BITS Pilani is an institute for higher education, 
deemed to be a university under section 3 of the UGC Act in the year 1964. It is one of the earliest 
to be recognized so. Ever since, in keeping true to its legacy and in following the mandate given 
by its Founding Chairman, BITS Pilani has pioneered a number of visionary initiatives in 
education and research, establishing an impeccable and formidable reputation for excellence. 
BITS Pilani has been consistently ranked first among the private colleges of India. Over the years, 
BITS has provided the highest quality of technical education to students from all over India. Its 
graduates can be found throughout the world in all areas of engineering, science and commerce. 
BITS is a symbol of India’s maturing technical ability and "can-do" entrepreneurial spirit. One of 
the missions of BITS is to impart knowledge to and educate students in those areas of science and 
technology which will best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century. 
Following in the footsteps of several universities, including a few Indian universities, in 2013, 
BITS, Pilani decided to foray into space through a nanosatellite project, called Anant. 
The main objective of the mission is to perform cost-effective hyperspectral imaging using a 
miniature hyperspectral imager that offers high resolution spectral imaging capabilities for a wide 
range of remote sensing applications such as agriculture, forestry, water monitoring, disaster 
management and climate research among others. The collected data will also be used by a faculty 
team from BITS Pilani for studying the effects of invasive flora species on native flora species.

2 Mission 
This project presents a wonderful learning experience to students and faculty as it offers them the 
opportunity to work on a real life multi-disciplinary complex system. We have elaborated upon 
various aspects of the mission below. Our approach has been driven by an intense passion to make 
some possible innovations in system design, while keeping in mind the financial budget for our 
project. 

2.1 Mission Objectives 

 To empower students of BITS and to give them an opportunity to learn the skills required 
to develop a satellite through various phases of design, analysis, fabrication and testing. 

 To acquire knowledge in the field of Satellite and Space Technology. 
 To gain experience in system engineering and team work. 
 To demonstrate the possibility of hyperspectral imaging in nanosatellites using an FPGA 

for on-board compression. 
 To analyze oceans using the collected hyperspectral data. 
 To build an On-board Computing System in order to support this kind of imaging in a small 

satellite, given the power constraints. 
 To gain experience in maintaining a satellite in orbit. 

2.2 Mission Specifications 

Since our main aim is to show the possibility of using hyperspectral imaging in small satellites, 
we chose a camera which also best satisfied the power, cost, mass and size constraints. Given 
below are a few specifications of the camera, which were kept in mind while selecting it: 

 Total weight < 1.5 lb. (< 0.68 kg) 
 Focal plane array format (pixels) - 640 x 480 
 Bit depth - 12-bit 
 Spectral bands - 270 
 Total image size = 640 * 480 * 270 * 12 bits = 0.927 Gbits. 
 Power requirements - 9-24 VDC ~10W. 
 Size (with lens) (inches) ~ 3.0 x 3.0 x 4.7 (not including GPS). 
 Speed of image acquisition – 300fps. 
 One image has 270 frames, and hence, one image is taken in 0.9s. This ensures that even 

though the power is high, the energy consumed is low because the camera needs to be 
switched on for lesser time. 

 
Based on the resolution and given spectral range, the camera can be used for ocean analysis. Using 
natively designed optics will allow us a better spatial resolution which will enable us to use it for 
different applications, including agriculture. 
The data generated by the camera is large in quantity and needs to be downlinked. However, there 
is limited time in which this data can be downlinked, hence there is a need to compress the image. 
The compression algorithm takes large amount of time and power. In order to combat these 
requirements, an FPGA is used as our secondary payload. It is used to run the compression 
algorithm which allows faster processing at lower power. Other advantages of the FPGA include 
the fact that we can reconfigure it partially, which allows us to uplink other algorithms and/or 
make changes in the old one.

In order to efficiently use the FPGA and to avoid hassles with interfacing it to the main processor, 
we have used the System-on-Chip (SoC) concept by using the Zynq-7000 device by Xilinx, which 
has been explained further in the Onboard Computing (OBC) section. Even though the FPGA is 
our secondary payload, it is used as part of the OBC and has been talked about extensively in that 
section. 

2.3 Payload Specifications 

2.3.1 Remote Sensing 

Remote sensing refers to the technology of acquiring information about the earth’s surface (oceans 
and land) and atmosphere using the remote sensing devices onboard the satellites. There are a vast 
number of applications of remote sensing and hence it can be divided into various subsections as- 

 Optical remote sensing 
 Infrared remote sensing 
 Microwave remote sensing 
 Hyperspectral imaging 

2.3.2 Hyperspectral Imaging  

 Hyperspectral remote sensing, also known as imaging spectroscopy, is a relatively new technology 
that is currently being investigated by researchers and scientists with regard to the detection and 
identification of minerals, terrestrial vegetation, and man-made materials and backgrounds. 

 Some of the benefits of hyperspectral and multispectral imaging are that these technologies are:  
 Low cost when compared with traditional scouting methods). 
 Give consistent results, simple to use 
 Allow for rapid assessments 
 Are non-destructive, highly accurate, and have a broad range of applications including 

astronomy, agriculture, biomedical imaging, geophysics etc.

concept of hyperspectral 

spectroscopy. The graphs in the

2.3.3 Concept 

Hyperspectral imaging provides a great amount of spectral information to identify and distinguish 
between different spectrally similar materials. It has a potential of more accurate and more detailed 
information extraction than what is possible with other types of remotely sensed data. 
Hyperspectral cameras take data in hundreds of spectral bands. These measurements are narrow 
and contiguous in nature. The biggest advantage is the identification of spectrally similar materials. 
As an example: Figure 2, given below, is the image from [1] showing the similar spectra of 
kaolinite and alunite taken from NASA’s hyperspectral AVIRIS sensor. One could distinguish 
them due to double dip in kaolinite which would not be possible with multispectral Landsat ETM 
sensor. 

 Figure 2 Spectra of kaolinite and alunite taken from NASA’s hyperspectral AVIRIS sensor  

2.3.4 Scanning Modes: 

Scanners are used to reflect the object surface 
onto the detector pixel, in our case the need is to 
acquire accurate data which is not affected by the 
undulating terrain and the satellite movement. 
There are generally two types scanning methods: 
Pushbroom scanning: In this data is acquired 
when the platform moves perpendicular to the 
pixel in the detectors. As platform moves data of 
pixels is collected line by line, as can be seen in 
Figure 3. Hence, it is called a line scanner. 

 

Figure 3 Line scanner

Whisk broom scanning: In this as the platform 
moves along the track, the to and fro motion of the 
attached mirror reflects the whole terrain to the 
detector. This can be seen in Figure 4. 
 
Pushbroom has more integration time as compared 
to whiskbroom and whisk broom requires moving 
parts which are not favorable for small satellites. 
Pushbroom sensor can have varying sensitivity 
which can be removed in preprocessing by 
calibration of sensor.

2.3.5 Benefits 

 Various scientists have successfully used hyperspectral imaging data to identify vegetation 
species [3] and also to detect vegetation disease, monitor against drought and nutrient stress. 

 The spectral characteristics of oil seeps and oil-impacted soils are difficult to detect using 
multispectral cameras. While hyperspectral cameras can detect the hydrocarbon signatures and 
this data could be used to detect oil seeps. [4] 

 Hyperspectral data is very useful in determining economically interesting minerals as shown 
in [5] 

 Drought is a significant factor in predicting crop yields and the final success of a crop. Early 
detection of water related stresses in field crops can allow producers to identify specific areas 
for irrigation, hence saving water, energy, and time. Early detection might also allow farmers 
to deliver water to crops before the yield gets affected by drought. The SOC-700 hyperspectral 
imager was able to track the development of water stress four days before the effects of the 
stress were observed with the naked eye as shown in the article-
https://surfaceoptics.com/applications/precision-agriculture-hyperspectral-sensors/ 

2.3.6 Challenges 

Hyperspectral cameras have not been used with nanosatellites due to mass, power and size 
constraints. Apart from that, there is also a constraint on the power needed to transmit the large 
amounts of information generated. 
Processing limitations: 
Ideally, in order to examine a region, we need to evaluate suitably large amounts of data. Presently 
a single image clicked by the selected camera is about 0.9 GBits. To be able to downlink the data 
to the ground station it becomes necessary to compress the image with minimal loss. This 
compression algorithm requires quite a lot of processing power. Using a micro-processor system 
means that the processor will be busy with the compression for a long time and will not be available 
for other processes requiring processing time. We thus need to use a solution which reduces the 
processor usage. 
Power limitations: 
A hyperspectral camera images in excess of 200 wave bands which requires a lot of power for the 
camera as well as for the ADCS for fine pointing the camera. This is one of the main reasons why 

6 
 



hyperspectral imaging has not been implemented in nanosatellites. This has just been made 
possible due to the launch of some small hyperspectral cameras. 
The amount of data produced also presents a significant challenge for the power system. The size 
of data to be downlinked in one transmission is more than that done by normal nanosatellites in 
their entire lifetime. Since all this data has to be transmitted, significant power is required for an 
extended period of time. This presents another challenge for the Electrical Power System of the 
satellite. 
Communication limitations: 
For most of the nanosatellites flown till date, large amount of data was usually not generated on-
board. Statistics indicate that over a course of 5 years a meagre 797 MB of data was downlinked 
from 24 nanosatellites. There are 2 main reasons for this - stringent power constraints and short 
communication time with the ground station due to the presence of nanosatellites in LEO. Also, 
the power constraint does not allow the usage of a very directive antenna, as that would require 
the ADCS to fine point during data transmission, which in turn increases the power consumption. 
Transmitting data at high speed requires a very good compression algorithm and the selection of 
the optimum frequency at which the data is transmitted. 
Apart from these, there is also a major constraint of mass and size of the camera. Hence a trade-
off needs to be done between various cameras available in the market. 

2.3.7 Solution to challenges 

The data downlink constraints are combated by implementing a compression algorithm on board. 
The algorithm has been described in detail in the appropriate section and promises compression of 
even upto 4 times in some cases, with an average compression ratio lying between 2-3. 
The power constraints are mostly in terms of the compression algorithm, the camera itself is on 
only for a few seconds to click a picture. To combat the power constraints of the implementation 
of the algorithm, it has been implemented on the FPGA fabric of the zynq-7000 SoC. As given in 
[6], where they have implemented the algorithm on a Virtex-5 XC5VFX130, it resulted in very 
low device utilization (2 percent of Slice LUTs), hence ensuring low power consumption. 
There is a plan to study the trade-offs between various methods of implementation in order to 
obtain the optimal performance in terms of power and compression ratio on our own as well. 

2.3.8 Imager Selection 

Five hyperspectral imagers currently available in the market were compared. The parameters that 
were used for comparison can be seen in Table 3. Headwall-Nano-Hyperspectral camera, 
manufactured by Headwall Photonics, meets all the mission requirements and hence, has been 
chosen as the primary payload. Compared to other cameras, it has a larger spectrum range, a higher 
frame rate and a larger number of spectral bands. It also meets the size and mass constraints for a 
3U nanosatellite. 

2.3.9 Payload Specification 

This section provides insight into the payload specifications to meet the mission specifications.  
Images are taken in a wide range of wavelengths – 400 to 1000 nm. It follows a concentric imager 
design that features aberration correction technology. It is a spectrometer with the grating designed 
over a spherical surface, where one spherical surface is reflective and the other one is reflective as 
well as diffractive. Both are concentric to each other. 
 

7 
 



Here the system is divided into two parts. The first one contains a slit through which the light 
enters (which act as a collimator of light) and a good quality image of the slit is formed over a 
spherical concave mirror (which helps in reducing the error caused due to aberration). The second 
part i.e. the spherical grating surface forms various images of the slit in different wavelengths 
when it receives the radiation from the reflective concave mirror. 
 
Now the light from the grating falls onto a normal CMOS detector and a whole hypercube is 
formed as the satellite moves over the surface.  The slit’s image formed in each resolved waveband 
is straight, such that it falls on a single line of charge-coupled device (CCD) elements. The line 
spectrum of each resolved point in the target image is also straight and orthogonal to the 
monochrome slit images. Each point spectrum image, hence, falls on a single CCD column. This 
design has low stray light, high signal to noise ratio and no moving parts, making it suitable for a 
satellite.  
 
The optics will be bought along with the camera as a system. Currently, no work is done in terms 
of optics design and realization. However, it may be required to have an optics design which can 
improve the current ground resolution per pixel (nearly 300m) to 100m per pixel. The talks for a 
custom optics design from the company are ongoing. However, whether the company will design 
the system to meet our requirements or they expect us to give a design for the same has not been 
finalised yet.  
 
A GPS unit can be placed on the camera, such that it stores the position where the image is taken, 
this information can later be used for orthorectification of the image as the terrain is curved.  
However, a GPS unit is not planned for our satellite. According to the company, one could either 
purchase the camera with or without the GPS unit. The team has decided to buy the camera without 
the GPS unit as we will have onboard attitude determination system to get the knowledge about 
the position and orientation of the satellite while taking pictures. Moreover, this will also save us 
the power that will be consumed by the GPS unit. As power is the major constraint in the project, 
it was decided not to buy the camera with the GPS unit

2.3.10 Procurement and Lead Time 

Currently the camera model and the specifications are being finalized with the company. Once it 
is done and the order is placed, it should take not more than a year to receive the product. Hence, 
the current estimate for the lead time is 1.2 years including the phase for design and model 
finalization. Two imagers are being finalized, one for testing and the other for actual flight 
model. However, owing to the budget constraints it is preferred that only one imager is bought. 
The company, Headwall Photonics provides imagers to NASA as well and their products are all 
space grade. It is expected that they will deliver the product after running all tests necessary for 
space components. The final decision for the number of imagers will rest on the tests expected 
by ISRO and the facilities extended by the company.

2.4 Orbit Selection 

The following points were kept in mind while deciding a suitable orbit: 
 The orbit should pass over the primary ground station and all the secondary ground stations as 

well, if any. 
 The orbit may be elliptical or circular. If it is elliptical, it should be such that its co-ordinates 

vary in all the three space-dimensions and it is possible to image the same area multiple times. 
If circular, the orbit has to be polar sun synchronous. Since the latter are more frequent we 
have chosen to have a polar sun synchronous satellite. 

 The orbit should be at sufficient altitude for the module to be facing an appreciable amount of 
radiation, so that fluctuations for the same can be estimated. Hence, a height of 600 km has 
been chosen. 

 The module should avoid the core regions of the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly as much 
as possible as the radiation in this anomalous field is too high to be safe for the module. 

 The satellite has to sustain radiation from the sun directly as well as radiation in the form of 
reflection from the earth. The solar radiation remains relatively constant because the source is 
far away. On the other hand, albedo radiation depends on the altitude. For the same reason a 
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) has been chosen. 

The reason for the frequent utility of an SSO (Sun Synchronous Orbit) is that it readily provides 
many desirable orbital characteristics which satisfy key mission requirements. Since the orbital 
inclination is nearly polar (96.5 -102.5 deg), the SSO provides global coverage at all latitudes (with 
the exception of just a few degrees from the poles). The position of the line of nodes remains 
roughly fixed with respect to the sun's direction, hence lighting conditions along the sunlit ground 
track remain approximately the same throughout the mission. 
On the basis of the above considerations, the following orbit characteristics were decided: 
 Orbit Type - Polar Sun Synchronous 
 Altitude - 600km 
 Inclination - 98° 
 Life ~1 year

3 Spacecraft Configuration 
The main objective of the mission is to show the feasibility of hyperspectral imaging in small 
satellites, the payload has been chosen accordingly. As stated above, the choice of a hyperspectral 
camera as our payload mandates faster processing and large data-transfer rates, which further 
requires us to use an FPGA in addition to the processor. Hence, it enables us to use the System-
on-Chip (SoC) concept. The satellite's functioning has been divided into modes which have been 
listed in the OBC subsection, since it makes the final decision of transitioning from one mode to 
the next. The satellite performs the desired functions due to the combined functioning of the 
various subsystems, which are given as below: 
1.) Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) 
2.) Onboard Computer (OBC) 
3.) Communication System (Comms) 
4.) Electrical Power System (EPS) 
5.) Payload 
6.) Structural and Thermal Design System 
 
The Comms subsystem allows the satellite to maintain contact with the ground station, which can 
be used to uplink and downlink data. Data uplinked will mostly include commands and data 
downlinked will include housekeeping and payload data. The communication protocols required 
for communication will be implemented on the OBC processor. 
The EPS provides electrical supply to the various components on the satellite, hence controlling 
what all devices are on and off in different modes. The EPS is the only other subsystem, than the 
OBC, which has its own processor allowing it to interface to the battery and solar panels, whose 
statuses it needs to monitor. EPS also uses its processor to implement the Maximum Power Point 
Tracking (MPPT) algorithm. It sends critical data like battery temperature, power surges and other 
housekeeping data to the OBC. 
Attitude Determination is the process of determining the orientation of the satellite relative to an 
inertial frame. This attitude can then be controlled to point the satellite in the desired direction and 
control its spin. To determine the attitude a variety of sensors like sunsenors, magnetometers, 
gyroscopes and accelerometers are used along with algorithms like extended Kalman Filter. Based 
on the determined attitude, the required attitude and their difference the satellite is controlled by 
using actuators like magnetorquers and reaction wheels which are directed using various control 
algorithms. All ADCS sensors are interfaced to the OBC, algorithms are run on the OBC and 
actuating commands which are obtained as outputs from the various algorithms are also sent from 
the OBC. 
The thermal subsystem is responsible for maintaining the satellite’s components at their 
operational temperature range and preventing over-heating of components, which is detected by 
installing temperature sensors at the required areas. In collaboration with the EPS the thermal team 
implements active thermal protection for the battery which can function only in a certain 
temperature range. 
The structural subsystem designs the structure so as to withstand the loading conditions the satellite 
experiences during launch and in orbit, keeping it within the constraints as specified by Calpoly. 
It is also responsible for placement of the components so as to maintain maximum stability and 
protect them against the harsh space environment. 

13 
 



The primary payload of the satellite is a hyperspectral imager which is interfaced to the OBC via 
a novel design in order to increase the efficiency of data transfer. The payload is also monitored 
for temperature using a temperature sensor which is interfaced to the OBC. 
The OBC is like the switch board of the satellite, it communicates between all the other subsystems 
and determines which mode the satellite should be in based on the different housekeeping data 
collected. It also runs the ADCS algorithms, communication protocol and most importantly 
controls the data flow from the payload. Another important task undertaken by the OBC is running 
a compression algorithm on the FPGA which decreases the size of the image to make it suitable 
for downlink.

Life    :  ~ 1 year 

3.2 Payload Configuration 

Electrical Aspects: The payload consumes a power of 10W and operates in a DC voltage range of 
9-24V. Standard voltage supplies are of 3.3V and 5V (these were taken from the datasheet which 
can be found in figure 5), hence we require a point of load converter to provide the required 
voltage. The other option is to provide a dedicated bus, but since it is only used for short periods 
of time this would only increase the power dissipation without providing any real purpose most of 
the time. 
Though the power consumption is high, because of the high fps, the image acquisition process 
takes only about a second, hence decreasing the overall energy consumed. 
 
Thermal Aspects: The camera has an ideal operating temperature, in order to ensure that the 
satellite is functioning in that range a temperature sensor is installed on it which will be interfaced 
with the OBC. The camera will be switched off if the temperature exceeds the functional 
temperature range. 
 
Mechanical and Thermal Aspects:  The key requirements of the payload include Field Of View 
(FOV), pointing accuracy, stability and thermal isolation. Our payload being large and heavy will 
be the main component affecting the configuration design. The location chosen for it is the forward 
end of the satellite, opposing the interface to the launch vehicle. Though its weight proves a demerit 
at this location, it is still chosen because 
 It is easier to provide a clear FOV at this end. 
 It is sensitive to shock, so it is kept away from the Launch Vehicle (LV) separation interface. 
 Structural load during launch is highest at the LV interface, and it is hard to keep large and 

sensitive payload out of the primary load path. 

14 
 



Aspects related to ADCS: The camera has a pointing accuracy of 0.025°, this implies that before 
taking images the camera needs to be pointed towards the target area with an error of only that 
much, which means the ADCS needs to run the fine pointing algorithm. 
Aspects related to interfacing the payload and the OBC have been dealt with in payload controller 
and in the OBC section. 
 

3.3 Structure 

The mechanical structure plays an important role during launch as it has to withstand the static and 
dynamic loading and vibrations induced. In orbit, the structure protects the internal components 
against the harsh space environment. Hence a complete structural analysis is necessary for the 
satellite, which is undertaken by the structural subsystem. The following are the responsibilities of 
the group:  
 To choose the optimal design, material and framework for the satellite body by testing and 

simulating the loading conditions during launch and in orbit. 
 To allocate resources of dimensions and space to all other teams. 
 To provide means of mounting, fastening and cushioning all components safely. 
 To design a stable structure with moments complying with the requirements of the Attitude 

Control subsystem. 
 To design mechanisms for the deployment of the onboard antenna and facilitate 

communication by rotating the antenna used on the ground station. 
 To test the satellite model for resistance to shocks and thermal vacuum conditions. 

3.3.1 Categories of Structures  

 Primary Structure - It is the major load path between the satellite’s components and the launch 
vehicle. It carries the shear, bending moments, axial loads and torsion. 

 Secondary structure - It includes support beams, trusses, antenna dishes, and solar panels. It 
provides shielding against space environment and thermal paths for heat transfer. 

 Tertiary structure - It includes component housing, mounting brackets, connector panels and 
cable support brackets. [7] 

3.3.2 Selection of Material  

The selection of the material is based on various criteria which are defined as under: -  
 Stiffness 
 Thermal conductivity 
 Stress corrosion resistance 
 Machineability 
 Fracture toughness 
 Attachment 
 Availability and cost 
 
Aluminum alloys are used favorably in primary and secondary structures as it has the best 
conductivity to weight ratio, desired thermal expansion coefficient and thermal conductivity.  Due 
to strict limitation on weight, titanium and steel are not used because of their high density. Light 
metals like magnesium and beryllium are expensive and difficult to machine, and are hence not 
used. 

15 
 



A comparative study for select material properties was done as given in Table 5 below:

Ti-6Al-4V 4430 113.8 680 75 310 

Taking into account all the factors mentioned above, Al 6061 T6 was chosen as the material.

3.3.5 Mass Properties 

The final mass properties were obtained after the assembly of the detailed design in SolidWorks. 
It gives the center of mass of the satellite, which comfortably fits within the constraints defined by 
Calpoly for a 3U Cubesat. The moment of inertia properties are used by the ADCS subsystem to 
calculate the disturbance torques. They are described as follows: -

Izx = 4243.17     Izy = 13116.22    Izz = 6013515.76 
 

3.3.6 Mechanical Constraints 

The mechanical requirements as ruled by the Calpoly standards are as follows [8]:  
 The mass of the full assembly shall not exceed 4 kilograms. 
 The center of gravity should be located within 7 cm from its geometric center in the 

principal direction and 2 cm along the other directions. 
 At least 75% of the rail will be in contact with the P-POD rails. 25% of the rails may be 

recessed and no part of rails will exceed the specification. 
 Rails should have a minimum width of 8.5mm. 
 Deployables should be constrained by the Cubesat, not the P-POD. 
 The Cubesat rails and standoff which are in contact with the P-POD rails and adjacent 

Cubesat standoffs, should be hard anodized to prevent any cold welding within the P-POD. 

3.3.7 Configuration Tradeoffs 

 Payload: The key requirements of the payload include Field Of View (FOV), pointing 
accuracy, stability and thermal isolation. Our payload being large and heavy will be the 
main component affecting the configuration design. The location chosen for it is the 
forward end of the satellite, opposing the interface to the launch vehicle. Though its weight 
proves a demerit at this location, it is still chosen because 

o It is easier to provide a clear FOV at this end. 
o It is sensitive to shock, so it is kept away from the Launch Vehicle (LV) separation 

interface. 
o Structural load during launch is highest at the LV interface, and it is hard to keep 

large and sensitive payload out of the primary load path.  
 ADCS: The selected method of control dictates the satellite shape. The center of mass of 

the satellite should be as close to the center of pressure as possible, which is the centroid 
of the satellite’s projected area. Alignment is very important in ADCS sensors, so they are 
grouped on one platform, which is stiff and thermally stable to reduce errors from 
distortions. For reaction wheels, we align them with the satellite axes, and add a wheel at 
the critical axis to provide redundancy. [9] 

 COMM:  The magnetorquers are required to be placed away from antenna to prevent 
interference. 

 Power subsystem: Shadows from deployable components like antenna have to be avoided. 
During launch, acoustics accompanied with transient loads usually cause the highest loads 
in the solar panels and other mechanisms. The location of battery is dictated by its weight, 
temperature sensitivity and cabling. A heavy battery should be packaged as near as possible 

18 
 



to the launch vehicle interface. The battery also needs a location with uniform and 
somewhat low temperature to maximize the depth of discharge. Since the battery generates 
heat during use, a lot of radiator area is required to maintain low temperatures. 

 Thermal Subsystem: For passive thermal control, proper location of powered satellite 
components is required along with the effective use of radiators, insulations and coatings. 
The best location for heat generating components and radiators is the side of the satellite 
with the least exposure. For LEO, heating can be minimized by shading components from 
planetary emissions and facing radiators away from the earth.  

 System aspects: Reliability, design life, maintainability, cost, schedule and launch, and 
space environments also need to be taken into account. 

 PCB Assembly: The placement of PCBs has to be optimized in order to minimize the 
connections and the wires. Three possibilities for PCB Assembly were considered, which 
are described as follows-  

1. A stack arrangement of PCBs, which is fixed to the main structure. It has an 
advantage of higher rigidity as the PCBs are interconnected by a secondary 
structure. It is disadvantageous from a weight point of view and difficulty in 
establishing connections between non-neighboring PCBs. 

2. Arrangement at the faces of the satellite. The PCBs can be firmly fixed at the 
main frame, and saves space. However, a lot of wiring is required in this case 
which makes assembly/disassembly difficult. [10] 

3. Arrangement in slot using a motherboard (Back Plane Arrangement). The various 
subsystem boards are attached to the motherboard. It offers the advantage of 
minimizing the wiring and increasing the flexibility for disassembly. However, 
making this arrangement is very difficult as it requires complex circuitry 
knowledge. [11] 

After careful consideration, we have opted for the stack PCB arrangement out of the three, since 
it is easier to establish and can be easily assembled in our satellite.

3.3.8 Methods of Attachment 
The following considerations should be kept in mind while choosing the type of attachment to be 
used 

 Joint Strength 
 Fatigue life 
 Type of structure and application 
 Alignment 

19 
 



 Access 
 Materials of the joining parts 

The possible methods of attachment are described as follows:   
1. Fastening - Most fasteners consist of a load bearing shaft and a head or nut on each end. 

This type includes threaded fasteners and rivets. They add damping to the structure. They 
are suitable for structures and mechanisms made of ductile materials, however they also 
add to the weight of the satellite. 

2. Welding - It is a permanent form of attachment. It can cause distortions and cracks in some 
materials. Disassembly is not possible in this method. 

3. Adhesive Bonding - Adhesive bonding is used for isolating solar cells from the support 
structure. It offers the advantage of distributing the loads over the entire joined region 
instead of locally at the fasteners. However, disassembly is not possible in this case too. 
[12] 

For our satellite we have used titanium standoffs and rivets for internal assembly and adhesive 
bonding for bonding between solar panels and internal assembly. 
The following table gives a list of possible adhesives that can be used. ScotchWeld2216 has been 
considered as a possible option based on factors such as reliability, coefficient of thermal 
expansion, cost, cure temperature etc.

3.3.9 Design 

A detailed model of the satellite consisting of all the external and internal components was 
prepared using SolidWorks. Such a model helped us to understand the placement of different 
components inside the satellite. The coordinate system is taken to be Y axis as the principal axis 
of the satellite, and X and Z axes taken so as to form a right handed coordinate system. 

20 
 



3.3.10 Primary Structure: 

The primary structure consists of the internal frame of the satellite and a different face plate 
assembled at the end at which the payload is kept. M3 flat head screws are used for attachment. 

Figure 11 Face plate - payload end 
Figure 10 Satellite's internal frame 

3.3.11 Secondary Structure 

It includes the panels, PCB assembly, battery assembly, reaction wheels and imaging payload. 
Battery Assembly - The battery assembly consists of two batteries with a heating element between 
them and the whole system enclosed. 

Figure 14 Battery assembly 
 

Figure 13 PCB assembly - reaction wheels Figure 12 Standoffs 

PCB Assembly - The PCB Assembly consists of the Telemetry Board, EPS Board, ADCS Board 
and the CDHS motherboard mounted in stack configuration using titanium standoffs and 
interconnected using connectors on the sides. 

21 
 



The reaction wheels used for 3-axis stabilization are mounted on the three sides of the frame. The 
X and Z axis reaction wheels are mounted between the payload and the PCB assembly, while the 
Y-axis reaction wheel is mounted behind the PCB assembly.

internal frame Figure 15 Single reaction

Payload - The payload consists of a Hyperspectral imaging camera mounted on front end of the 
satellite. The dimensions of the camera in inches are 3x3x4.7, with a spectral resolution of 5-6nm 
and a wavelength range of 400-1000nm. 

Figure 17 Payload - hyperspectral camera 
Antenna - A deployable antenna is used which is mounted on the payload end of the satellite. The 
hole in the middle of the antenna is of the same diameter as the aperture ring, so as to form a snug 
fit of the antenna on the camera base.

Solar Panels - The solar panels are bonded to the internal assembly using adhesives. The X and Z 
solar panels consist of 7 solar cells each. It also contains a sun sensor mounted on the external side 
and magnetorquers on the other side, with a provision for an access port and RBF pin. The Y solar 
panel consists of two solar cells.

3.3.12 3D exploded view 

The assembly of the PCBs and the battery stacks are done under following considerations: 
1) Battery stack is among the massive equipment so should to be placed farther away from 

the centre of mass in order to balance it with the payload, thus battery was placed near +Y 
face, mounted on the EPS board.  

2) Standoffs are chosen in place of endless screw+spacers assembly in order to easily integrate 
and disintegrate PCB stack without disturbing each PCB  

3) The PCBs used for the assembly were as per PC/104 specification which offers ‘stack 
through’ and ‘non-stackthrough’ Bus. Thus, PCBs can be placed anywhere in the stack. 

23 
 



4) Also, according to the specification, there is a space of 15mm between each PCB.  
5) The material of standoffs can be changed in later stages to more conducting/insulating 

material in order to prevent heating/cooling of PCBs.

3.3.14 Analysis 

The satellite has to be designed to withstand the loads it experiences during launch and in orbit. In 
the initial design phase, the mechanical loads and vibration spectra imposed on the satellite are not 
clearly defined. Thus the satellite has to be designed to withstand the highest potential loads 
encountered during its lifespan. Finite element analysis was used using ANSYS Workbench 
software to estimate the deformations and stresses that the satellite will experience under quasi 
static loading conditions. The dynamic and vibrational analysis has not been currently shown and 
will be done at a later stage. 

3.3.14.1 Model 

Due to the complex design and abundance of components inside our satellite, it is very difficult to 
mathematically model everything inside our satellite. Hence a simplified model is used to represent 
only the load bearing structural components. 

Figure 28 Simplified model on ANSYS 

3.3.14.2 Static analysis 

The high levels of acceleration, vibrations and shocks experienced by the vehicle during launch 
are transmitted to the payloads attached to the flight decks of the vehicle and impose strict 
requirements on the overall structure. Lateral loads are considered to act along with longitudinal 
loads with respect to launch vehicle. Quasi-static acceleration of 11g acts along the longitudinal 
direction and 6g along lateral direction. [13] The results are obtained as follows –  

Table 8 Results of Quasi-static analysis 

Maximum Von Mises Stress 5.7 MPa 
 
Maximum Deformation 9.16x10-3 mm 
Maximum Strain 0.00019459 

27

Figure 30 Equivalent Von Mises Stress for Quasi Static Load Condition 
 

28 
 



Figure 31 Total Deformation for Quasi Static Load Condition 

 3.3.14.3 Internal Frame Analysis 

The static analysis of the internal frame is performed by loading the frame with the entire weight 
of the assembly assuming it to be nearly 3kg, considering margin for wiring and other 
discrepancies. Again a simplified model has been used for analysis.  

Figure 32 Simplified internal frame model on ANSYS 
For the worst case scenario, the satellite is subjected to an equivalent acceleration as of the 
satellite, i.e. the loading this structure would face if its mass had been 3kg. Thus the equivalent 
acceleration of gravity becomes equal to (M/m) g, where M is the mass of the satellite, and m is 
the mass of the internal frame. 

29 
 



From the mass budget, we obtain the weight of the internal frame as 351gms. 
Thus the equivalent acceleration due to gravity = (3000/350) g = 8.57g 
Equivalent acceleration in longitudinal direction = 8.57 x 11g = 94.27g 
Equivalent acceleration in lateral direction = 51.42g 
The results obtained are as follows: -

Maximum Von Mises Stress 10.34 MPa 
 
Maximum Deformation 6.2x10-2 mm 
Maximum Strain 0.00015057

30 
 



Figure 35 Total Deformation for Internal Frame Worst Case Load Condition 
The safety factor obtained for the worst case is high enough to assume that the satellite will not 
fail under the application of quasi static loads during the launch. The satellite structure satisfies 
all the requirements imposed by other subsystem as well as conforms to the mechanical 
constraints as imposed by Calpoly Cubesat Design Standards.  
 

3.3.15 Antenna Deployment System 

3.3.15.1 Requirements and Constraints 

● Antenna need to be stowed in such a manner that it can be deployed without any hindrance 
and least power is required to deploy them. 

● The ADS must work in the typical eclipse-sunlit temperature range of -50o C to 70o C and 
the vacuum. 

● It is decided to place the antenna on the face with the camera lens. This leaves 5 faces for 
solar panels which enhances the maximum utilization of sunlight and albedo radiation. 

● RF connections are to be done ensuring that the antenna is rigidly placed so that at the time 
of deployment the antenna does not get displaced or detached. For this guides are used 
which have the sole purpose of easy and safe deployment(safe because any contact with 
the body of satellite at the time of deployment will lead to displacement of antenna or 
damage) 

● As a rule of thumb, for any antenna design to be functional it must have a characteristic 
length of at least ¼ of the transmitting wavelength. For the UHF band, this corresponds to 
approximately 20 cm of length (detailed calculation is yet to be done).  

● The antenna should be fabricated from a highly elastic material that springs to a rectilinear 
shape when released. 

 
 
 
 
 
 

31 
 



3.3.15.2 Components 

ADS consists of the following components: 

 Antenna 
 Antenna holder arms 
 Springs 
 Antenna setup base 
 Antenna setup top 
 Bolts and nuts for antenna holder 
 Bolts and nuts for antenna setup 
 Nichrome wire strip 
 Nylon strip/dyneema (to be decided) 

 

3.3.15.3 Selection of Material 

Antenna material and other secondary components such as fasteners should be fabricated using 
material with similar mechanical properties to avoid failure due to internal stresses during ellipse 
and sunlit phase. For antenna the material chosen is BERYLCO 10.Beryllium copper, which is a 
ductile, weldable, and machinable alloy. It is resistant to non-oxidizing acids, plastic 
decomposition, abrasive wear, and galling. It can be heat-treated for increased strength, durability 
and electrical conductivity. Beryllium copper with the strength of 1,400 MPa is highest among of 
any copper-based alloy. It can be machined into intricate shapes and has high fatigue strength and 
resistance to local deformation making it suitable material for antenna. 

3.3.15.4 Deployment Mechanism 

The deployment mechanism requires that the antenna should be coiled on a single face of the 
satellite, as opposed to being wrapped around the satellite. The release mechanism, utilizes a 
compression spring system in order to apply a force and a stroke to the nichrome burn wire. When 
a constant current is applied to the nichrome wire, it will thermally cut through a Vectran tie down 
cable allowing it to release the deployable antenna. The deployed position of the VHF and UHF 
antenna’s axis should be orthogonal to each other for better RF performance of the antennas. Dual 
redundant deployment system offers a safe and secure deployment. 

3.3.15.5 Design 

The basic design model consists of an envelope in which antennas are stowed in a coil. Individual 
slots are machined which contain the antennas. For the design process ISIS deployable UHF/VHF 
antenna design is under study. The advantages of using this design are as follows: 

● Configuration of the antennas can be changed. We are using an omnidirectional antenna 
which may lead to a loss of 3dBi at the ground station due to the polarization difference. 
There exists trade-off between an omnidirectional antenna and a turnstile antenna. The 
latter is circularly polarized and reduces this loss but requires more power. The current 
ADS design allows us to switch between the two possibilities, if needed, based on the link 
budget. 

● The antenna is behind the camera lens when deployed which sorts out the problem of FOV 
blockage due to antenna span. 

32 
 



● The compact structure goes under the feet of payload face of Cubesat. This is safer, in 
terms of launching vibration, than the one in which the whole ADS is on the face-plate of 
the Cubesat. Individual antenna have slots in which they are stowed in a coiled manner. 
This can be a reliable approach as the excess length of the dyneema/nylon wire can be 
checked and a common heating element solves the areal constraint. Moreover, heat loss to 
the space is minimized to a comfortably low level in the envelope. 

● A 30mm centre through hole can be utilized for our camera lens.  
 

3.4 Thermal Control 

Satellites are generally subjected to extreme temperature variations in space, ranging from -50°C 
to +80°C. Most of the components are designed to operate within a certain range around the room 
temperature. If the temperature limits are not maintained, their performance decays drastically, 
ultimately leading to failure. The role of the thermal subsystem is to design thermal management 
solutions that can satisfy the operational limits of all the components installed on the spacecraft. 
The orbital parameters also play a huge role in determining an effective thermal design. Our 
satellite would be operating in a Low Earth Orbit that has a period of the order of an hour and a 
half. In such a case, the satellite receives environmental heating flux in the form of direct sunlight, 
sunlight reflected off Earth (albedo) and infrared energy (IR) emitted from Earth. The temperature 
control can be achieved, either by using passive methods, such as surface finishes, paints, 
multilayer insulations, etc. or active methods such as heaters, louvers, etc. For their cost 
effectiveness and flexibility, passive measures are usually preferred, however, active means may 
be required when passive measures are not able to provide enough thermal protection. 

3.4.1 Thermal Requirements  

Our satellite, being a 3U Cubesat, is exposed to extreme variations in temperatures. It consists of 
various components such as solar panels, a battery stack, a PCB stack, magnetorquers, a 
hyperspectral imaging payload, etc. All of these have particular working temperature ranges and 
it is the responsibility of the thermal subsystem to ensure that these components work within their 
specified range only. 
The satellite would be orbiting the earth in a polar sun synchronous orbit at an altitude of 600kms, 
with an inclination of around 98.1°. The orbital time period is nearly 92 min with a 37% eclipse 
period. 
The operating temperatures of the various components are summarized as follows: 

Table 10 Operating temperature range of satellite components 

S. No. Component Operating range (°C) 
1 Magnetorquer -40 to +80 
2 Battery 0 to +30 
3 Sun Sensors -60 to +80

5 Reaction Wheels 0 to 50

7 OBC -20 to +70 
8 Magnetometer -40 to +80 
9 Structure -45 to +65

3.4.2 Satellite Thermal Environments 

The principal forms of environmental heating fluxes in orbit are direct solar radiation, sunlight 
reflected off of the earth (also known as albedo) and infrared energy emitted from the earth’s 
surface. 
The intensity of solar radiation reaching the Low Earth Orbit depends on the distance of the earth 
from the Sun. The intensity is at a maximum of 1417 W/m2 during winter solstice and a minimum 
of 1327 W/m2 during summer solstice.

365
IE is the current solar constant, and n is the day number of the year 
IEmin=1327 W/m2, IEmax=1417W/m2 
Albedo is the solar radiation that is reflected back from the earth. Albedo heat flux decreases as 
the satellite moves along its orbit and away from the sub-solar point (the point on earth where the 
sun is directly overhead), even if the albedo constant remains the same. This is because the albedo 
factor is a reflectivity, not a flux. For earth, the reflectivity is assumed to be around 34%. However, 
it can vary to as high as 80% for shiny clouds, and as low as 10% for forests and oceans. 
All the incident solar radiation which is not reflected as albedo is absorbed by the earth and 
eventually re-emitted as infrared (IR) energy. The intensity of infrared energy emitted at any given 
time depends on factors such as the local temperature of earth's surface and the amount of cloud 
cover. These localized variations in earth-emitted infrared radiation, although significant, are much 
less than the variations in albedo, and hence can be neglected. As a first approximation, a value of 
around 240W/m2 can be assumed as emitted from the Earth’s surface. [14] 

3.4.3 Heat Transfer 

There are three modes of heat transfer which are described below: -  
 Conduction: When a temperature gradient is present within a solid, thermal energy will flow 

from the region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature. It is described by 
Fourier’s law as follows: -  

∆𝑇
Qcond = kA           (2) 

∆𝑥
where k is the thermal conductivity, ∆x is the length of conduction path, and ∆T is the 
temperature gradient. Conduction takes place within the internal components as well as 
between the face plate and internal assembly. 

 Convection: Convection occurs due to the movement of molecules within fluids. Due to the 
extremely low density of the atmosphere at the orbital altitude, there are no mass or particles 
for convection processes. The surrounding background temperature in space is 3 K due to 
presence of very less matter in space, which is very close to absolute zero. Thus there is no 
energy transfer between hot and cold areas due to convection. [15] 

 Radiation: Radiation is the only mode of heat transfer which does not require any medium for 
heat transport between two bodies. It is the most significant of heat transfer which occurs in 
space. The radiation energy emitted by an object is governed by its surface properties, 
geometry, relative position with respect to other thermally significant objects and its surface 
temperature. 
 Q=𝜎. 𝜖. 𝐹𝑖𝑗. 𝐴. 𝑇4         (3) 
Where σ is the Stefan Boltzmann Constant (5.67*10-8 W/m2 K4), 𝜖 is the emissivity of the 
surface, T is the surface temperature, A is the surface area, and Fij is the view factor, which is 
the proportion of radiation which leaves surface i that strikes surface j. 

34 
 



The view factor from general surface A1 to another general surface A2 is given by:-

𝐹1→2 = ∫ ∫                                                                                            (4)

Where, 
s= distance between differential surfaces 1 and 2 
𝜃1, 𝜃2= Angle between the surface normal to differential area (dA1 and dA2 respectively) and the 
radius line to surface. 

3.4.4 Basic Laws 

 Wien’s displacement law - Wien's displacement law states that the black body 
radiation curve for different temperatures peaks at a wavelength is inversely proportional 
to the temperature. 

𝑏
𝜆𝑚𝑎𝑥 =                                                                                                                                   (5) 

𝑇
Where T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin, b is the constant of proportionality, equal 
to 2.897 mm K. 

 Kirchoff’s Law - Kirchhoff’s law states that absorptivity at any given wavelength and 
temperature is equal to emissivity at the same wavelength. 

ε(λ, T) = α(λ, T)                                                                                                                      (6) 
The two laws stated above help us in arriving at an important conclusion. The spacecraft 
absorbs solar radiation in a different wavelength (visible region) and the emitted 
wavelength is at a lower temperature, and hence at higher wavelength. Thus the emittance 
occurs in the infrared region. Thus the emissivity and absorptivity of the satellite material 
would be defined differently and will not be the same. 

3.4.5 Radiation Energy Balance in LEO 

The overall thermal control of a satellite in orbit is usually achieved by balancing the energy 
emitted by the spacecraft as IR radiation against the energy dissipated by its internal electrical 
components plus the energy absorbed from the environment. The heat is exchanged within the 
components by conduction and rejected from the satellite into outer space by radiation.

3.4.6 Thermal Analysis Calculation Approach 

The following approach will be considered for obtaining the detailed thermal model of the satellite. 

36 
 



 

Figure 37 Approach for thermal modelling 

3.4.7 Temperature Control Methods 

 MLI Blankets - Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) Blankets are made up of multiple thin sheets 
of a highly reflective material, and a netted spacer material. MLI primarily reduces heat 
loss by radiation, but is not much effective in reducing heat loss by conduction. It works 
on the principle of radiation balance and Stefan Boltzmann’s law. Ideally, a perfectly 
insulating blanket would be a blanket that reflects 100% of the incident radiation. However, 
it is very hard to fabricate a single sheet blanket that accomplishes this. So many highly 
reflective layers are stacked on top of each other in order to achieve higher and higher 
reflectivity, and further reduce radiation losses.  The individual layers should not touch, as 
they would transfer heat between them, resulting in no added insulation benefit. So a spacer 

37 
 



material is required to space them apart for this purpose. The satellite would be thermally 
insulated using MLI blankets with sufficient window cut outs. 
The following table gives a list of the probable MLI blankets that may be used [16]:

 Optical Solar Reflectors - They consist of a second surface mirror (reflector having a low 
emissivity) under a transparent cover (having a high emissivity).They are used to reduce 
the absorption of external solar heat loads and increase the heat rejection capability of the 
external radiators at the same time. The metalized reflector reflects a large percentage of 
the incident radiation. Silver coated Teflon is commonly used due to its low cost and high 
ruggedness. Currently, we are considering the use of 2-mil silvered Teflon for use in our 
satellite, based on surface properties and cost, which would be used in the window cut-
outs.

 Adhesive Tapes - Pressure sensitive adhesive tapes are used to close blanket edges and 

cutouts, and aid in electrical grounding of the blanket. Usually, the tape should have the 
same properties as the surface to which it is applied. Double-sided transfer adhesive tapes 
may be used to make tape from a blanket material, to laminate two thin films, or to bond a 
thin film (or a blanket) to an object. Tapes made from aluminized or gold-coated plastic 
films are appropriate for use where a low emittance is desired, such as on interior layers of 
a blanket. Electrically conductive adhesive tapes can be used in grounding the blanket 
layers.  
The following adhesive tapes have been taken into consideration for use in the satellite 
from the vendor THERMATTACH®. The final product will be decided by considering the 
surface properties and cost. We are currently considering the use of THERMATTACH 
T410 in our satellite.

 Paints and metallic finishes 
Black paint is used on the interior of the vehicle to facilitate radiation heat transfer among 
the heat dissipating internal components. The white paints are used on the exterior surfaces 
to minimize absorbed solar energy. Most of the paints have a high emittance. The paint is 
chosen considering the electrical conductivity, solar absorptance and ease of application to 
meet grounding requirements [17]. Low-emittance metallic finishes are used in cases 
where radiative heat transfer is required to be minimized. These include Kapton tape with 
a vapor-deposited aluminum or gold coating (metal side exposed), bare or polished surfaces 
of aluminum components, or bare stainless steel. For our satellite, we are considering the 
use of PCBZ as a white paint and ML-210-IB as a black paint.

 Heaters - To avoid low temperatures during the eclipse the implementation of heaters has 

been found to be an adequate solution. Heaters can be used with thermostats or solid-state 
controllers to provide precise temperature control of a particular component. Another use 
for heaters can be to warm up components to their minimum operating temperatures before 
the components are turned on. Most commonly a patch heater is used in active thermal 
control of a satellite. It consists of an electrical-resistance element sandwiched between 
two sheets of flexible electrically insulating material, such as Kapton. 

Figure 39 Kapton Patch Heater [14] 
In case of a battery, the efficiency and capacity decreases rapidly as soon as the temperature 
falls below the operating temperature, a heater is essential for the worst cold case condition 
of the satellite. Currently the best possible option for the heater is MINCO 
HK5186R25.0L12, having an ohmic resistance of 25Ω, which satisfies the power 
requirement of 1W, with an effective area of 0.84 cm2.

3.4.8 Temperature Sensors 

Temperature sensors are required to measure and send relevant thermal information to the EPS 
and the OBC. These sensors would be installed on all the boards of the satellite, on the camera and 
the battery of the power subsystem. The EPS will toggle the thermal controls of the battery heater, 
while the OBC will turn off the PCBs if they start overheating. 
The LM75 temperature sensor is chosen because of its I2C two-wire interface and low power 
consumption. The LM75 temperature sensor includes a delta-sigma analog-to-digital converter, 
and a digital over-temperature detector. The host can query the LM75 through its I2C interface to 
read temperature at any time. The LM75 temperature sensor measures the temperature and 
converts the data into digital form using a band-gap type temperature sensor and a 9-bit delta-
sigma ADC. An I2C-compatible interface allows access to conversion results. The LM75 accepts 
standard I2C commands to read the data, set the over-temperature alarm (OS) trip thresholds, and 
configure other characteristics.

3.4.9 Heating System Design 

A heating system has to be designed for the worst case cold condition of the satellite. Two options 
are possible for heater control. The first one uses the On Board Computer (OBC) and takes the 
temperature of the batteries and voltage into consideration. The second way is to bypass the OBC 
and develop an autonomous control loop with EPS. The second method is preferred as it is more 
reliable in case of OBC failure (the heating system would be still operational and the batteries can 
still feed the beacon). The following control loop can be used to control the heater. If the 
temperatures of the batteries drop under a given threshold, the heater is switched on until the 
batteries are again within the allowable temperature range. 

Figure 42 Heating System Control Flow Chart 
The heater is used in parallel with two sensors to increase the reliability of the system. A third 
sensor can also be used; if two sensors give different temperatures, the third one enables us to 
determine the defective sensor. To reduce the radiative losses and increase the heater efficiency, 
the batteries can be insulated by covering them with a low emissivity aluminum tape. 
 
Temperature sensors and Heating element will be placed underneath every battery stack and on 
CDHS PCB board (yet to be finalised). CDHS temperature sensor placement decision will take 
place after simulating the heating of CDHS PCB for exact working time. It is also decided to place 
one temperature sensor on critical point of satellite and the location will be decided after detailed 
thermal simulation and testing of entire mass model of the satellite in order gather details about 
thermal environment of the satellite. A temperature sensor will also be placed at the payload in 
order to ensure functional temperature range for it.

3.4.10 Thermal Simulation 

3.4.10.1 Introduction 

The process of thermal simulation is divided in two parts: 

 Simplified Preliminary thermal analysis 
 Preliminary thermal analysis 
 Detailed thermal analysis 

The simplified preliminary thermal analysis is performed on SatTherm. SatTherm was developed 
and verified by Cassandra Belle VanOutryve of San Jose State University in 2008 in 
collaboration with engineers at NASA Ames. The program consist of Multiple Functions which 
take input from a excel environment. SatTherm is chosen to perform preliminary simulation 
because it is easy to use and open source. The program was verified with commercially available 
and highly trusted software package and the results match closely to one another with 
temperature difference of approximately 4° C. [19] 

3.4.10.2 Simplified Thermal Analysis 

For the preliminary analysis of the satellite only six node arrangement is considered.  Each node 
is located on side of the satellite body. The nodes are considered to be two dimensional in nature 
and appropriate thickness and surface area is calculated to model the face of the satellite. For each 
node contact resistance is considered. No internal heat source is considered and thus the idea of 
the thermal simulation is to provide a crude working temperature range for the satellite. 

 

Figure 43 Mathematical model and local coordinate convention 
 

Since S1, S3, S4, S5, S6 70% surface of the satellite will be covered from solar panels and S2 will 
be covered with 100%. The estimated absorptivity and emissivity are as follows:

Maximum temperature reached was 308 K whereas minimum temperature reached was 249K, 
considering the inputs given in the tables below. Measures have to be taken to bring the satellite 
temperature in the permissible range and the subsystem is currently reviewing the different options 
of passive temperature control to achieve the means. Multiple nodes and internal heat loads have 
to be considered to give more accurate values and we are currently preparing a preliminary thermal 
model.

3.5 Power System 

The Electrical Power System (EPS) is tasked with keeping the satellite alive and functional by 
providing continuous energy supply. It should supply enough power to carry out all the on board 
tasks by fulfilling the voltage and power requirements of different subsystems. Along with this, it 
has to do some secondary tasks like protect components from radiation latch-ups and ensure 
maximum power input to the satellite.  
The main components of EPS are: 

 Solar Panels 
 Batteries and battery module 
 Power Control Unit 

o Over Charge protection circuits (OCPC) 
o Power Regulation Unit (Includes converters and I2C bus) 

 

 
Figure 52 Block diagram showing overall configuration of EPS 

3.5.1 Microcontroller 

The EPS is implemented on a microcontroller unit (MCU) which is interfaced to the Onboard 
Computer through an I2C bus.  
The MCU performs these functions:  
 Collects data from temperature and voltage sensors on the solar panels and batteries 
 Runs the MPPT algorithm 
 Sends the ‘Simple beacon’ (before OBC start-up) 

51 
 



 Communicates the subsystems’ On/Off status as well housekeeping data collected by the 
EPS 

 Tracks the battery temperature and turns on the battery heater in case it goes below a certain 
threshold 

 Tracks and regulates the battery status and charging 
 The choice of the MCU is based upon the following factors  

 Power Consumption 
 CPU speed 
 ADC interface 
 IO pins 
 Bus compatibility 
 RAM and Program memory 

Keeping these factors in mind, MSP430F1610 has been selected as it fulfills all the requirements 
while consuming minimal amount of power. 

3.5.2 Output Voltage Control 

Components present on the satellite vary in size, power consumption and frequency of use. Most 
of them operate at 5V or 3.3V, but some require higher voltages (like the communication module 
or the payload module) but since both of them are used considerably less frequently compared to 
others, they are given Point of Load (POL) [20] converters as a dedicated bus will only increase 
the power dissipation without providing any real purpose most of the time. As such, there are 
three power lines present on the satellite – 3.3V, 5V and an unregulated line. All the components 
work from these power lines. 

3.5.3 Protection 

Since any damage to the satellite cannot be fixed, it is very important to ensure its robustness. 
Without the earth’s atmosphere, the satellite is vastly exposed to radiation effects from the Van 
Allen belt or through solar flares. The satellite is protected from these by radiation hardening as 
well as setting up Over Current Protection Circuits (OCPC). One of the effects of radiation is 
Single Event Latch-ups which cause a surge of current in the circuitry of the satellite. OCPCs act 
like fuses by detecting such an event and severing the supply. It is designed to withstand a 
maximum current which a subsystem might need. If it draws more supply than this threshold the 
supply is cut. 
In cases where the OCPC has to turn off a user, it has to signal the event to the OBC through the 
MCU. The OBC can then decide whether to leave the equipment switched off or switch it back 
on. This is done to ensure bringing back of equipment that failed due to SEL without damaging 
it. After the OCPC has switched off the equipment and sent a signal to the MCU, it awaits the 
“switch back on” signal from the MCU. The OCPC then switches back on the equipment 
expecting that the equipment is back in order. 

52 
 



The values of different R decide the threshold current above which the circuit breaks. The Op-
Amp works as a comparator and the transistor acts as the switch. [21] 

Figure 53 OCPC circuit [21] 

3.5.4 ON/OFF of Individual sub-system 

The ON/OFF of each subsystem is ultimately controlled by the OBC by signaling the EPS when 
to switch a particular subsystem on. If a subsystem is shut down due to a trip-up, the EPS detects 
it first and then lets OBC know that there has been a default. After which, the OBC waits for a 
while and then signals the EPS to try and switch it back on. In case a subsystem is shut off due to 
an emergency, then OBC starts subsystems one by one and the EPS confirms that it has indeed 
turned on.  

3.5.5 Communication of House-keeping Information  

Communication with the OBC happens via an I2C bus. The EPS MCU acts as a slave and OBC 
acts as the master for all communication. 
The housekeeping of the satellite is being done by the OBC except for the EPS components like 
the solar panel temperature and voltage, this information is relayed to the OBC periodically. The 
EPS collects the information it needs for decision making more frequently than other like the 
MPPTC return current or the battery return current and temperature. The information relayed 
however is uniformly distributed among all the data. EPS collects the following data: 
 Current through solar panels (4 of them) 
 Voltage across the parallel connection of solar panels 
 Voltage across the battery pack 
 Temperature of Battery 
 MPPTC return current 
 Voltage on main power bus (3 of them) 
 Converter current  
 EPS temperature 
 OBC, Payload, beacon and transmission current 

53 
 



 Free Temperature (4 of them) 

3.5.6 Communication of User On/Off status 

The user on/off status is one of the information relayed to OBC during a periodical 
Housekeeping data transmission. If the status information is requested by OBC, then the last 
known status of the subsystem is returned. 

3.5.7 OBC Boot Selection Interface 

After the satellite in launched in orbit, a kill switch is released which brings the EPS to life. After 
the EPS gets switched on, the following boot procedure is used for the OBC: 

 After sending a signal to the OBC to switch it on, an external watchdog starts count in the 
EPS waiting for a response from the OBC. This current process signals the OBC to 
undertake boot from the PROM. 

 If such a response is not received in the stipulated time, the FSBL is signaled to shift to 
trying to boot from the image in the flash drive. 

 This process continues till either one can successfully be used to switch on the OBC. 
Once the boot has been successfully achieved, for the rest of the time, the watchdog timer 
continues to work on the EPS, sending periodic signals to the OBC, expecting a response in turn. 
If a response is received timer is reset, if not then the OBC is rebooted. [22] [23] 

Figure 54 I-V curve 

3.5.8 Maximum Power Point Tracking 

The MPPT algorithm is implemented to track the point on the I-V curve of a solar cell where it 
can provide maximum power output, thus significantly increasing the efficiency. This is usually 
done by using a converter which regulates the voltage to match that of the batteries while 
maintaining the peak power voltage for the solar panels. The voltage provided by battery when 
directly connected to a solar cell is usually different from the maximum value. The alternative 
solution (Direct Energy Transfer) is only efficient when the battery voltage (charge) is high, 
which is counterproductive as it needs to be more efficient when battery charge is low. Since 
power efficiency is a priority for out satellite, MPPT was selected. 
There are several types of MPPT algorithms of which Perturb & Observe (P&O) [24] [25] was 
selected as it is the most stable, robust and is comparatively easy to implement. This method only 
uses the fact that the power increases on changing duty cycle while approaching the maximum 
power point from any side. We keep increasing the duty cycle till we get incremental gain in 
power. Hence arriving at the maximum power point.

* They are rough estimates and are subject to change. 
Occasionally, battery heater might be turned on to ensure that the battery remains in its range of 
operating temperature. This is a priority task and would require a power 1W for 5-10 minutes. 
The battery temperature will be frequently polled. If the temperature falls below a threshold, the 
heater is immediately turned on.  

3.5.10 Battery 

The battery capacity is decided by maximum energy required in the eclipse region. Since the 
satellite has only one pass over the transmission region and that pass can come in the shadow 
region, it has to be made sure that there is enough battery capacity for that. Also the satellite 
must be able to take an image in the shadow region. All other power intensive processes are 
delayed till the day region. This includes running the compression algorithm and the retrieval of 
data from memory. Keeping this in mind the capacity is calculated from above as: 
Power (Transmission) * T (Transmission) + P (Idle) * (Eclipse time – T (Transmission)) =  
4.7W * 10min + 2.1W * 20min = 1.48W-hr  
Safety Margin = 50% 
Number of cycles during lifetime = 15* 360 = 5400 
Number of cycles by default = 500 
Required Capacity = 1.48 * 1.5 * 5400/500 = 23.976W-hr 
Based upon this analysis, 30W-hr battery capacity should be sufficient for the satellite. This can 
be implemented by using a 3P2S combination which should provide enough current for peak 
power consumption.  
 

3.5.11 Solar Power generation in an orbit 

Currently the work on orbital simulation is going on. Without the orbital simulation details, it will 
be difficult to calculate/simulate the solar power generated for different local times. Also, orbital 
simulation is a precursor in determining the time duration for each mission mode. However, the 
maximum load in any given mode is pre-calculated keeping a safe margin and is given in tabular 
format in section 3.5.9 of the technical proposal. Hence, once the orbit is simulated, we will be 
able to give more quantitative data regarding the power consumption in an orbit during different 
phases and modes of the satellite. 
 

3.5.12 Power generation margin 

The solar radiation in low earth orbit is 1367 W/m2. Solar cells are not 100% efficient, cells 
commonly used from Spectral Labs provide 28.8% or about 453.53 W/m2 (under ideal radiation 
and at peak efficiency). Accounting for the fill factor (assumed 70% here) representing a percent 
of the surface covered by solar panels, leaves us now with only 317.47 W/m2. This amount of 

57 
 



power (317.47 W/m2) is the amount on the surface at an incident angle of 0o . As the surface tilts 
away from the sun, the energy is spread out such that only 317.47 ∗  𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜃) W/m2 is generated 
(where 𝜃is the angle between the panels normal vector and the sun vector). Assume that the sun 
sweeps over the panel in only 1 axis (i.e. travels from parallel to perpendicular to parallel again), 
then we can average out the power to now only 202.11 W/m2 (this is due to averaging of 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜃) 
over 0 to 𝝅/2 ).  
This, however, is where orbit as well as attitude planning and control starts to make a difference 
in our discussion as tumbling, nadir pointing, and sun pointing satellites will all generate different 
amounts for the same orbit and time. Another considerable factor is regulation efficiency is that 
most DC-DC converters will saturate out at about 90% efficiency, leaving 181.9 W/m2 left for 
storage and use by other systems. The orbit also does not spend its entire time in the sun , our 
satellite will spend 33% of its time in umbra (on an average), so if the power is averaged over an 
entire orbit only 121.51 W/m2 is available. The final factor that should be considered is the end of 
life (EOL), taken as 95% for our cells. Thus, we have a final irradiation value of 115 W/m2. 
Now for a 3U satellite, We can assume an area of 30cm x 10cm x √2as our base area. Since both 
the longitudinal sides will be facing the sun during sun-pointing. After calculations we get 4.88 W 
of power.  
We will not execute compression and data communication in the same orbit. This gives us the 
maximum load of 2.98Whr in one orbit which is equivalent of 1.99W, considering orbital time of 
90 minutes. So, the margin of the system is 59.22% which is very close to the required 60%.

3.6 OnBoard Computer 

The Onboard Computer is responsible for controlling and coordinating the other subsystems, 
while performing data processing if required. We intend to develop a reliable design for an 
onboard data handling system of a small satellite. The design aims at equipping a System-on-
Chip based onboard computer with multitasking capabilities necessary for a small satellite and 
ensuring a judicious utilization of the computational and data processing software and hardware 
resources with reduced time latencies. The SoC includes a dual core microprocessor and a Field 
Programmable Gate Array. The FPGA will be loaded with the hyperspectral image compression 
algorithm, while the microprocessor will perform other tasks that are required of the OBC, 
including the Control Algorithms. 

3.6.1 OBC functions: 

 Acquiring housekeeping data. 
 Storage and downlinking of payload and housekeeping data. 
 Executing attitude determination and control algorithms. 
 Determination of the mode of operation and flow of control. 
 Processing of the Telecommand Data. 
 Acquisition of the image and execution of the compression algorithm. 

3.6.2 Hardware requirements 

It is expected that a data rate as high as a gigabit would be required by the satellite payload. 
This demand requires an architecture which would be able to process data at a high rate. FPGAs 
are a suitable solution to this situation. FPGAs have a high computational speed (due to their 
parallel processing abilities) combined with less power consumption. [26] [27] 
Hardware for the OBCS was chosen keeping in mind the required processing power and power 
budget. One solution for high processing power using minimal power is a SoC device containing 
an FPGA. 
Such devices integrate both a processor and an FPGA on a single silicon chip. Integration of 
these two technologies on a single chip has many benefits including smaller board size, less 
power consumption, higher bandwidth for communication between processor and FPGA. 
Also, a lot of interfacing between the FPGA and the processor that would have been required is 
now done within the chip. 

3.6.3 Hardware description  

3.6.3.1 Zynq-7000 All Programmable SoC 

Zynq-7000 integrates a feature-rich dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 based processing system (PS) 
and 28 nm Xilinx programmable logic (PL) in a single chip. The ARM Cortex-A9 CPUs are 
the heart of the PS and also includes an on-chip memory, external memory interfaces, and a rich 
set of peripheral connectivity interfaces. 
The following are its main characteristics: 
 A 1GHz, dual-core, ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore microprocessor sits at the heart of Zynq All 

Programmable SoC.  
 The two ARM processors communicate with on-chip memory, SDRAM and Flash memory 

controllers, and peripheral blocks through the ARM AMBA AXI-based interconnect. 

59 
 



Together, these hardened blocks constitute the Zynq-7000 All Programmable SoC’s Processor 
System (PS).  

 The on-chip PS is attached to the Zynq device’s on-chip Programmable Logic (PL) through 
multiple AXI ports, creating extremely efficient coupling between these two key components 
of the Zynq architecture.  

 The inbuilt interfacing between the programmable unit (PL) and the ARM cores (PS) reduces 
any compatibility and interfacing issues that can arise while using an external FPGA unit for 
this purpose separately.

3.6.4 Device and Process Management  

The Onboard Computer also overlooks the coordination between the devices and subsystems to 
ensure smooth functioning of the satellite. The process and device control will be undertaken by 
a flight software which will be coded in C/C++ and will be run on a Linux system which will be 
running on the Processing System. We have chosen a Linux system over an RTOS system 
because there is more extensive documentation for using a Zynq device based Linux system and 
also because it suits our scheduling needs.  
The OBC maintains regularly updated status of different devices interfaced to it. The flight plan 
software has different modes which further have processes within them that are initiated in each 
of these modes. On the basis of data obtained from the regular polling of various components in 
the satellite, decisions are made regarding entering and exiting these modes. In addition to these 
predetermined processes there also exist certain instances where various components can 
interrupt the flight plan in the form of critical messages which then forces the system to move 
into one of the emergency modes. All the modes have a predefined priority, so that if the polling 

61 
 



presents conditions suitable to move into multiple modes simultaneously, then the choice can be 
made. The OBC ensures that a busy device is not disrupted, unless the polling results in a mode 
request which has a priority greater than the one the device is currently catering to. Further, all 
the system critical interrupts (for example: power surge interrupt, critical temperature interrupt) 
will override all the priorities and will be catered to first. 
 
Our flight plan is tentatively divided into the following modes: 
Normal modes: 

1. OBC startup after launch 
2. Normal without downlink/uplink and without payload operations 

a. Without PL operations (Idle Mode) 
b. Data retrieval from camera’s memory to shared memory 
c. PL executing compression algorithm 
d. EPS implementing MPPT algorithm 

3. Normal without downlink/uplink and with payload operations 
4. Normal with downlink and without payload operations 
5. Normal with uplink and without payload operations 

Emergency Modes: 
 Watchdog reset (OBC failing to respond to EPS’s watchdog timer) - EPS cuts the power 

to OBC, waits for a certain period before turning it on. 
 Low Power -  

a. OBC shuts down a subsystem with lowest priority. 
b. OBC asks EPS for updated power usage. 
c. Steps ‘a’ and ‘b’ are repeated until system is in safe mode. 
d. The beacon will be sent less frequently and the housekeeping will be collected 

less frequently too.  
 Component or Subsystem failure - OBC tries to fix the failure by restarting the 

component. 
 Angular velocity overshoot - Switch into detumble mode. OBC runs the B-dot algorithm 

(high frequency) and directs actuators to stabilize the satellite.  
 Heating mode (Spike in the temperature of a subsystem) - The responsible subsystem will 

be shut down till the temperature returns to normal.  
 Power surge - If a component is using higher power than required, the EPS will switch it 

off using an OCPC and will send an interrupt to the processor, which will then decide to 
either switch it on or keep it switched off.

3.6.5 Sensor Interfacing 

A satellite in which all subsystems have their own processors is called a distributed architecture, 
and one in which all the processing is done by running the processes on the central OBC 
processor is called a centralized architecture. We have chosen to use an architecture which is 
somewhere between these two.  Following are the major systems, including their components 
which will be interfaced with the OBC: 

66 
 



 The Electrical Power System (EPS) has its own processor (MSP430F1611) and will 
communicate with the OBC using I2C interface. It will perform the following tasks: 
o Collects data from temperature and voltage sensors on solar panels and batteries 
o Runs the MPPT algorithm 
o Sends the Simple beacon (before OBC start-up) 
o Communicates the subsystems’ On/Off status as well as housekeeping data collected by 

the EPS to the OBC 
o Tracks the battery temperature and turns on the battery heater in case it goes below a 

certain threshold 
o Tracks and regulates the battery status and charging 

 The various components of the Attitude Determination and Control System, including 
actuators and sensors, will be directly interfaced to the various ports of the Processor System 
of the main board. The control algorithm will be run on the OBC, whose outputs will be used 
to actuate the satellite using the actuators.  
The component which will be interfaced with the OBC will include: 
o  5 Sun Sensors- SSBV (5×5 ADC) 
o  3 Magnetorquers- In-house  
o  2 Magnetometer- Honeywell HMC6343 (I2C interface) 
o  3 Reaction Wheels- HT-RW200.15 (I2C interface) 
o  Inertial Measurement Unit (Gyroscope & Accelerometers)- ADIS16334 (SPI        
Interface) 

 The Communication subsystem will receive and send data to the ground station and its 
components will be interfaced with the various ports on the Processor System of the OBC. 
The three layers of AX.25 communication protocol will also run on the operating system of 
the Processor System, which will be used during the communication. The components which 
will be interfaced with the OBC include: 
o  Transceiver for Data Transmission - NanoCom AX100 (I2C interface) 
o  OOK/ASK modulator for Beacon - RF2516 (4 GPIO Pins) 
o  Power amplifier for Beacon - THS9001 (Not to be interfaced with the OBC) 
o  Antenna for both Beacon and Data Transmission - ISIS deployable UHF and VHF 
antenna (I2C interface for antenna housekeeping data)  

 The Thermal System will carefully monitor the temperature of the satellite and suggest active 
and passive methods of countering temperatures higher and lower than pre-decided 
thresholds. Since the EPS has its own processor it takes the battery temperature readings on 
its own and takes the appropriate action to heat or cool the battery to meet its temperature 
requirements. This is the only device for which active temperature control is undertaken. 
There will also be temperature sensors on the solar panels which will be interfaced to the 
EPS processor. There are temperature sensors placed on all the three boards to monitor 
temperatures and also on the hyperspectral camera, the reading from these will be taken at 
regular intervals. This data, if critical will be acted upon by switching off the devices, else it 
will be logged and downlinked at a later time. 

 The payload (hyperspectral camera) is interfaced with the OBC via Ethernet and there is a 
elaborate process which is involved in data collection which has been described in the later 
sections. The reason for this kind of a process is due to its power intensive nature. 

67 
 



3.6.6 Monitoring and Status checking 

The OnBoard Computer is responsible for the overall health monitoring of the satellite’s 
subsystems, logging of critical housekeeping data for later downlink and controlling the devices 
interfaced to it including turning them on/off as and when required. Our OBC undertakes 
housekeeping in the following manner: 

3.6.6.1 How the housekeeping data is obtained from various subsystems 

 The OBC will issue a health check request to all subsystems at regular intervals, it will 
expect a response within a stipulated time.  

 In response, the subsystems are expected to send certain data, which will be system 
dependent and has been mentioned subsystem wise below. This data is sent over a system 
bus, where the OBC acts as a master. 

 For certain subsystems like the ADCS and the Communication system whose components 
are directly interfaced to the OBC, the OBC will take the data from the concerned 
components itself over the above mentioned interfaces. The same is true for the temperature 
sensors on the various subsystem boards and the payload. 

 A logging task will be activated after obtaining this data which will be responsible for 
timestamping and storing the HK data in memory. It is stored in the form of a linked list in 
flash memory (here, a linked list is used instead of an array so as to allow dynamic allocation 
of memory and hence, reduce memory waste). When a downlink is requested, the entire 
linked list is combined in one data chunk and is communicated in the downlink mode. 

 If a ping by OBC is not responded, OBC issues a request to the EPS to restart the particular 
board/subsystem. All events leading to a restart and all the following debugging related 
events are also carefully logged for later downlink. 

3.6.6.2 How is the housekeeping data used 

 This data will have a pre-decided format and will be analyzed by the system. 
 The satellite will be directed into one of the above mentioned modes on the basis of this 

analysis. 
 If any of the obtained readings is critical then it moves to an emergency mode, if not it moves 

to one of the normal modes. 
 Some amount of this data, which is absolutely critical for the functioning of the satellite, like 

the battery voltage, will also be sent to the beacon for regular transmission.  

3.6.6.3 Data collected from different subsystems and sensors are as follows 

 EPS: 
o System bus voltage. 
o Battery temperature and voltage. 
o Current supply to different subsystems/boards. 
o Solar panel current and temperature. 
o Converter Current 

 ADCS: 
o Sensor data from the 5 sun-sensors and 2 magnetometers to determine the attitude of 
satellite.  
o Angular velocity vector from the Inertial Measurement Unit for running the control 
algorithm and checking detumbling condition. 

68 
 



 COM:  
o Temperature from the board on which the communication devices are placed. 
o Deployment status, temperature of antenna. 

 Payload: 
o Temperature of the camera, obtained by the temperature sensor on the payload. 

3.6.7 Interaction with other subsystems 

So far we have discussed the information which the OBC will be collecting from these various 
systems on a regular basis, however there will be more interaction between the OBC and other 
subsystems, in which some commands and information will be relayed to the subsystems and 
demanded of the subsystem. The interaction between the various subsystems is elaborated in the 
following subsections. 

3.6.7.1 Electrical Power System 

Boot Sequence 

The OBC and the EPS are very intricately linked. As soon as the satellite is released into orbit, a 
kill switch is released and the EPS comes to life. The EPS then has the task of switching on the 
OBC. In the time lag between the EPS switching on and the OBC getting switched on, the EPS 
sends a Morse coded beacon using the communication subsystem, just to tell the ground station 
that it is “alive”. Once the OBC has been switched on, it will take on the responsibility of 
transmitting the ‘Advanced Beacon’ and downlinking data. 
The booting of the OBC and watchdog timer implemented on the EPS follow a format similar to 
the one followed by AAUSAT. [28] [29] The Zynq 7000 boots using the following procedure, as 
mentioned in the technical reference manual [22] [23]: 

 An internal BootROM stores the stage-0 boot code, which configures one of the ARM® 
processors and the necessary peripherals to start fetching the First Stage Bootloader 
(FSBL) code from one of the boot devices, which are specified below. The 
programmable logic (PL) is not configured by the BootROM. The BootROM is not 
writable. 

 The FSBL code is typically stored in one of the flash memories when in orbit. BootROM 
code copies the FSBL code from the chosen flash memory to on-chip memory (OCM). 
The size of the FSBL loaded into OCM is limited to 192 kilobytes. The full 256 kilobytes 
are available after the FSBL begins executing.  

 This architecture is different from the microcontroller used by AAUSAT, in the sense 
that the Bootstrap Loader is not stored in the internal memory of the device and is taken 
from an external device. A standard FSBL is made available on a Git server by Zynq 
which can be edited in the command line after downloading the source files. 

The FSBL can typically only be loaded by the BootROM from one of the following four devices: 
 SD Card 
 NAND Flash 
 Parallel NOR Flash 
 Serial NOR (Quad-SPI) 

The FSBL itself can be edited to then switch on various interfaces and can take the OS from any 
memory placed externally, though by default it takes data from the above mentioned devices. We 
can customize the FSBL code to use other PS peripherals such as Ethernet, USB, or Standard I/O 

69 
 



to boot and/or configure the PL. However, we refrain from configuring the PL just yet, in order 
to conserve power, and will configure it when required. 
It is imperative that the OBC start, as it controls all the other systems. The Zynq has multiple 
inbuilt error detection and correction methods to ensure that the FSBL gets loaded accurately. 
However, to ensure that the OS loaded is correct and has no errors, like AAUSAT, one copy is 
stored in the flash memory and another on an external PROM. This is because Flash drives are 
more susceptible to radiation damage.  
After the EPS gets switched on, the following boot procedure is used for the OBC: 

 After sending a signal to the OBC to switch it on, a watchdog starts in the EPS, waiting 
for a response from the OBC. This current process signals the OBC to undertake boot 
from the PROM. 

 If such a response is not received in the stipulated time, the FSBL is signaled to shift to 
trying to boot from the image in the flash drive. 

 This process continues till either one can successfully be used to switch on the OBC. 
Once the boot has been successfully achieved, for the rest of the time, the watchdog timer 
continues to work on the EPS, sending periodic signals to the OBC, expecting a response in turn. 
If a response is received it is reset, if not, then the OBC is rebooted.     

Other Communications with EPS 

Further, the OBC takes power, voltage and current supply values of the various subsystems from 
the EPS. Upon analyzing this housekeeping data, the OBC will decide if a particular subsystem 
should be shut off in case the values exceed the acceptable limits. OBC in such cases will send a 
command to the EPS to switch on or switch off the necessary subsystem. 
In addition to the above, during low power situations, the EPS will send a command to the OBC 
in the form of a hard interrupt. Subsequently, all important data will be stored in the flash drive. 
The OBC will then have the following priority table for shutting down the various subsystems, 
which will be done by the EPS: 

 Communication. 
 Payload. 
 Control Sensors and Magnetorquer. 
 OBC Circuit. 
 Beacon Circuit. 

3.6.7.2 Onboard Computing System Design and Control of Data Flow from Payload 

Traditionally, the onboard computers of satellites had minimal functionality, owing to design and 
power constraints. These on board computers were majorly responsible for processing 
housekeeping data and executing spacecraft control procedures. The payloads did not demand data 
processing. Today the observational instruments being deployed in satellites have computation-
intensive applications, which in our case is a hyperspectral imager. Hence, requiring additional 
components to become a part of the system, which in this case is an FPGA (Field Programmable 
Gate Array) used for computationally intensive image compression algorithms.  
Due to power, performance and downlink data transfer rate constraints of small satellites, 
hyperspectral imaging usage has largely been restricted to large satellites. To enable us to use a 
hyperspectral imager as payload, which requires faster on-board and downlink data transfer rates 
certain other changes have been made to the conventional designs. Our design is inspired by the 

70 
 



engineers of Cove, a satellite made by the University of Michigan to test JPL’s multispectral 
camera. [30] 
 
The following things need to be kept in mind before proceeding to the design: 

1) The camera stores the image in its internal memory (customizable) after taking the image. 
But the camera takes a lot of power. Hence, the image needs to be transferred from 
camera’s memory to the OBC’s memory so that camera does not need to be turned on 
whenever the image is to be accessed. 

2) The hyperspectral image is very large and the microprocessor must remain relatively free 
while the image is being transferred; whether from the camera’s memory to external 
memory or from the external memory to the FPGA. 

The data flow involving payload includes the following steps: 
1) First, the OBC checks if there is adequate power, if the answer is affirmative, then the fine 

pointing algorithm of the ADCS is implemented to achieve pointing accuracy sufficient for 
clicking a picture. 

2) The PS of the OBC then sends a command signal to switch the camera on and take the 
picture, since this a power consuming process and no other process should start while this 
one proceeds, other power intensive processes like downlinking of data must be curtailed. 
The obtained images are stored in the camera’s internal memory. For one image the camera 
is expected to stay on for about 2.7s. 

3) After this the camera is turned off. When there is enough power again, data is transferred 
from the camera’s memory to an onboard memory.  

4) After this, when there is enough power to run the compression algorithm on the PL the data 
is transferred from this memory in tiles, in order to facilitate parallel processing. After 
compression, the final compressed image is stored on the SD card attached to the PS which 
can be further downlinked to the ground station at the appropriate time.    

3.6.7.3 Communication and ground station 

All the components of the communication system will be interfaced with the OBC for 
housekeeping. For data transmission, only the transceiver will be interfaced.  The beacon 
transmitter will be interfaced with the EPS MCU (for ‘Simple Beacon’) and the OBC MCU (for 
‘Advanced Beacon’). The three layers of AX.25 communication protocol will run on the 
operating system of the Processor System. There are three different ways in which the satellite 
communicates with the ground station: 

 Beacon: It is a low power signal transmitted by the satellite carrying minimal information 
about the system. Our system has two beacon modes. 

o Simple Beacon: It is transmitted before the OBC is booted by the EPS. It carries 
only a Morse coded signal. The OBC commands the EPS to turn off the simple 
beacon once it’s booted. 

o Advanced Beacon: It contains minimal/critical housekeeping data and other 
satellite specific information. 

 Downlink:  Downlink will carry compressed image and the logged housekeeping data as 
per request. 

 Uplink: Uplink will carry commands, TLE data and software updates from ground 
station. 

71 
 



3.6.8 Command interpretation 

During the period in which satellite is communicating with the ground station, it may receive 
commands from the Ground station. The commands and requests from the ground station, are 
received and processed (demodulated) by the Comms system, after which they are relayed to the 
Onboard Computer. The Onboard computer will interpret the command and act on it 
accordingly. The ground station commands may include updating the OBC software (changing 
the flightplan), reconfiguring the FPGA and requesting for downlink of additional information 
and Two Line Element (TLE) updates. Upon receiving a command, the OBC may alter its 
schedule to ensure that appropriate action is taken and data (if any) is downlinked to ground 
station at the earliest. 

3.6.9 Compression algorithm 

As mentioned previously, in order to increase downlink data rate, computationally intensive 
compression algorithms need to be implemented on-board in a power efficient manner. At the 
same time, since hyperspectral images are needed for subsequent in-depth analysis, the 
compression cannot be very lossy as original data is required in its true form. Hence, there are 
three problems- heavy processing requirements, power constraints and image quality retention.  
In order to counter the first two, the use of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to perform 
image processing is suggested, to enable hardware based parallel processing. Optimized data paths 
in FPGAs allow improved performance of computationally intensive tasks and reduced power and 
energy consumption as compared to general purpose processors (GPPs). In comparison with GPPs, 
FPGAs have been observed to improve performance by more than 15 times at 50% of the energy 
consumption. 
The problem of compressing hyperspectral images is usually solved by two methods- by applying 
2-D compression algorithms taking advantage of spatial redundancy between neighboring pixels, 
or by taking advantage of the spectral redundancy of the same pixel across a certain number of 
spectra as well as spatial redundancy within the spectrum. The recent standard recommended by 
the CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems) for multispectral and hyperspectral 
image compression i.e. CCSDS 123.0-B-1 [31] has been chosen for implementation. The same 
was done because of ease of implementation over other methods like JPEG-2000 algorithm’s 
adaptation for 3-D images. This standard was built keeping in mind the power and memory 
constraints of small satellites and providing lossless compression. It has two primary components 
- a predictor and an entropy encoder. The predictor uses linear prediction techniques, and using 
values from previous spectra and neighboring pixels predicts the value of the current pixel. The 
standard advises the use of static codes like Golomb and Rice for entropy encoding. The block

diagram of the predictor and encoder is shown in the following figures. [32]

3.6.9.1 Some information about Hyperspectral Images and their different formats: 

Normal imagers work by using sensors which measure intensity of visible light. This intensity is 
then passed through different filters to obtain the intensities corresponding to Red, Green and Blue 
colours (Or possibly Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (Black) (CMYK)). These filters are placed 

73 
 



over the pixel sensors of an image sensor to capture colour information. Each image is hence 
composed of three images, one representing only red intensities of various pixels, another 
representing only blue intensities and a third representing only green intensities.   

Along the same lines, the sensors and filters placed in the hyperspectral sensors are used such that 
they image the scene in multiple spectral ranges, each image having a wavelength range of a few 
nanometers. Typically, Hyperspectral sensors image data over a few 100 spectral ranges. This 
results in each image actually being closely spaced layers of individual images, best imagined as 
a cube as shown in the picture below. In fact hyperspectral images are often called HyperCubes. 

In modern day imagers, resolutions are quite high and hence many pixels cover smaller areas, 
leading them to have largely similar colouring. Image compression often tries to take advantage 
of this correlation. In fact, a higher spatial resolution often implies better compression ratios.

3.6.9.2 Precursors to Compression Algorithms 

A lot of the material is based on [33]. We first define a few basic concepts:  

A Source is, as the name suggests a source of symbols, referred to as the Alphabet of that source. 
For example, a book is a source of symbols with English language as the Alphabet, similarly, an 
image is a source of symbols with 2^k possible symbols, where k is the number of bits being used 
to represent each pixel. The process of a source throwing out a symbol is called an event. 

Discrete-memoryless source: 

A Discrete Memoryless Source (DMS) is when the probability of the source throwing out a 
particular symbol is independent of the symbols which came before it. These kinds of sources 
rarely exist in real life. A DMS can be completely defined by its source alphabet and its 
corresponding probabilities i.e. S = {s1, s2, s3, … sn} and P = { p(s1), p(s2), p(s3), …p(sn)}. 

 

74 
 



Information: 

It is expected that an event with higher probability will have lower information associated with it 
and an event which is less likely to occur has more information associated with it. Further, the 
information of two unrelated (independent) events, taken together should be equal to the sum of 
the information of the two events taken one at a time.  

Considering, the above two statements, the information associated with an event si having 
probability p(si), I = -log2p(si). 

Entropy:  

The average information of the source is called the entropy of that source and is given by: 

H = - Σpi log2(pi)  

It would be appropriate, at this point to talk a little about extended Discrete memoryless Sources, 
but we do not use block encoding techniques in the current implementation of the algorithm and 
hence, at this stage, it suffices to say that if the symbols thrown out by the source are treated ‘N’ 
at a time instead of one at a time then it is called the Nth extension of the DMS. 

Markov Sources: 

In an mth-order Markov Source, as opposed to in a DMS, the symbols thrown out by the source 
are dependent on the previous ‘m’ symbols. Consider that the Markov Source has an alphabet of 
‘k’ symbols, then at a given point, the previous ‘m’ values each have ‘k’ options and hence there 
are km possibilities for symbols previous to the current one. Each of these km possibilities are called 
a state. Earlier, the information content was controlled by probabilities of the possible events, 
similarly, in the case of Markov Sources, the entropy of the source is controlled by conditional 
probabilities. 

State: A state is defined by ‘m’ previous symbols. That is, the state is defined as {s1,s2,....sm}, now 
for each such state, there are ‘k’ possible values for the next symbol. Hence, for each state, we 
have k conditional probabilities. That is p(k|{s1,s2,....sm}), for each k. 

Now for each state we first define, conditional entropy of a state as 

 H (S|{s1,s2,....sm}) = - Σp(k|{s1,s2,....sm}) log2p(k|{s1,s2,....sm}) 

And we use the above conditional entropy to define average entropy as follows: 

H(S) = Σ H (S|{s1,s2,....sm}) p({s1,s2,....sm}) 

Here, p({s1,s2,....sm}) is the probability of being in state {s1,s2,....sm}. 

Our aim during compression is to minimize the number of bits used to encode the source symbols. 
We first define a parameter, Average Length which can be a good measure of the number of bits 
used per symbol. 

Ḹ = Σ li pi 

Where, li is the length of the codeword associated with the symbol of probability pi. 

It would be good for us if there was a way to provide a lower bound for the minimum average 
length as that will help us approach a certain value. Loosely, the Noiseless Coding Theorem does 
that for us by stating that,  

75 
 



H(S)≤Ḹ, That is the average length of a source is bounded below by its entropy and at best can be 
equal to it. 

Entropy encoding: 

Entropy encoding or simply encoding encompasses various methods, preferable in various 
situations, all of which are used in an attempt to try to minimize the average length of the over-all 
source. 

We will briefly give an overview of a few techniques below, but we will not be discussing these 
in detail as they are not going to be used in the present algorithm being discussed. We are not 
discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each. Though there will be an attempt to compare 
various encoding methods at a later stage. Currently these methods are discussed because we want 
to present the importance of probabilities in entropy encoding. 

Shannon-Fano Coding: 

We know that in the limiting case, H(S) = Ḹ. 

For a DMS, this implies, H = ∑pi log2(pi) =   Ḹ = ∑li pi 

Hence, the best case scenario, li = log2(pi). 

But we need to observe that log2(pi) is not always integral and we will have to use, li = [ log2(pi) ], 
where [.] represents the smallest integer greater log2(pi), we use greater than and not less than 
because of Kraft’s inequality. This however, is a very crude method and only gives a guideline to 
follow and does not give most-efficient code values. 

Huffman Coding: 

Before going further, we will first describe prefix codes: 

Prefix codes are when symbols of a particular alphabet are assigned codewords in such a way that 
no symbol is the prefix for another symbol. By this we mean that the codewords 00 and 001 cannot 
both be used to encode symbols belonging to the same alphabet. Prefix codes are extremely 
advantageous in terms of decreasing the time complexity during decoding. Huffman encoding, 
Arithmetic encoding, Golomb encoding all give prefix codes as a result of the encoding method. 

The basic idea in most encoding techniques is to assign small codes to more probable symbols and 
the inevitable large codes to the less probable symbols. This ensures a smaller average length. In 
this method, at every stage the symbols having two least probabilities are combined, until we are 
left with only two symbols. Then the process is repeated with symbols being extended by adding 
a 0 and 1 at each stage. This process will become clearer by an example: 
 

76 
 



 
Figure 59 Example of Huffmann Coding – Source Reduction. [33] 

Consider a source with the Alphabet = {s1, s2, s3, s4, s5} and corresponding probabilities as shown. 
Now, in the original source, s4& s5 have the least probabilities, they are combined to give the 
symbol s2’. The reason that their probabilities are added is that say, s2’ is represented using 
codeword 1111, s4 will be given by 11110 and s5 will be given by 11111 and hence, at the s2’ stage, 
the symbol of the original source may be s4 or s5 and hence the probabilities are added. 

Now, as is visible, the process of combining the last two symbols is repeated until only 2 symbols 
are left. Then the encoding process starts as below: 

 
Figure 60 Example of Huffman Coding Codeword Construction. [33] 

 

Notice, that this kind of encoding process allows us to encode the symbols using only prefix codes. 
This greatly helps during decoding, because, assume that the string to be decoded is 1000010011, 

77 
 



now, we look at the first bit and we immediately know that the first symbol is s1, similarly, there 
is no symbol with three continuous 0s and hence, we know the second bit is s2 and so on. If instead 
s1 was encoded as 0 and the rest stayed the same then we wouldn’t know if the output code was 
s1s2 or s2s1. 

Arithmetic Coding: 

Arithmetic Coding is founded on two principle ideas, firstly, arithmetic operations on the 
codewords being used. Secondly, it maps the symbols to the interval [0, 1). Here will take a very 
brief overview of Arithmetic Coding, in reality arithmetic coding provides a very useful technique 
which can be used for ergodic sources as well. (Sources, where the probabilities of same symbols 
do not remain constant throughout the encoding process).  

For our example, let us consider that we DMS with only four symbols, s0, s1, s2,s3, having fixed 
probabilities, say ⅛, ¼, ½, ⅛, respectively. Now, let us assume the string to be encoded is {s2s2s1s3} 
as an example. Initially the probabilities are mapped to the interval [0, 1) as below: 

0 0.001 0.011 0.111 1 

s      
0 s1 s2 s3 

0.001 0.010 0.100 0.001 
 

We will use the nomenclature that a particular interval “belongs” to the symbol written on its left 
end. Notice that the interval belonging to a particular symbol has the length equal to the probability 
of that interval. Recall, the throwing out of a symbol by a source is called an event. We define 
CodePoint (C) and Interval (A). CodePoint refers to left end of the interval being used currently 
and interval refers to the length of that interval. Observe that before any coding, in the line above, 
the numbers above the line represent the cumulative properties (Pi) of the symbols.  

So before the first event, the C=0 and A=1, that is we have the number-line as represented above. 
The first symbol is s2 and below is the figure representation of what happens after the first event: 

0 0.001 0.011 0.111 1 

s   
0 s1  s  

2 s3  

0.001 0.010 0.100 0.001 

0.011 0.0111 0.1001 0.1101 0.111 

s     
0 s1 s2 s  

3 

0.0001 0.0010 0.0100 0.0001 
 

78 
 



So basically, what is happening is that the interval belonging to the current symbol gets divided 
into four parts again, proportional to the probabilities of the symbols. As you can see, the new 
CodePoint is now 0.011 and the new interval is 0.1. 

On the basis of how the new CodePoint and interval are obtained, we can arrive at the following 
formulae: 

Cnew = Cold + Aold*Pi , where Pi is the cumulative probability of the symbol being encoded. 

Anew = Aold*pi where pi is the probability of symbol being encoded. 

Using this process of, we get the following for {s2s2s1s3} 

After encoding first symbol,  

C = 0.011   

A = 0.1 

After encoding second symbol, 

C = 0.011 + 0.1 * 0.011 = 0.011 + 0.0011 = 0.1001 

A = 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01 

After encoding third symbol,  

C = 0.1001 + 0.01 * 0.001 = 0.1001 + 0.00001 = 0.10011 

A = 0.01 * 0.01 = 0.0001 

 After encoding fourth symbol, 

C = 0.10011 + 0.0001 * 0.111 = 0.10011 + 0.0000111 = 0.1010011 

A = 0.0001 * 0.001 = 0.0000001 

But how do we encode, to encode it any number in the interval, [ Cfinal, Cfinal + A) can be used, so 
in our case that would be [0.1010011,0.1010100). 

It is easy to see that soon, the large precision will begin to be a practical problem, but actual easier 
implementations of these have been described in the original paper. [31] 

3.6.9.3 Compressing Images 

By now it is clear that probabilities, and conditional probabilities in the case of Markov Sources, 
play a very important role in encoding sources. With this in mind let us now shift our focus to the 
task at hand, which is the Lossless Compression of images. Now assume that we have an image 
with each pixel of bit depth k (typically 8 or 16). Hence, there are 2k possible symbol values for 
each pixel. Now recall that, modern-day continuous images are not DMSs but are Markov Sources 
as neighbouring pixels are similar and the pixel next to a red pixel is likely to have a colour close 
to red itself. So let us assume that the image in question is a mth order Markov source. Hence, 
there are (2k)m states and for each of these states, there are 2k possible options for the next symbol. 
Hence, for each state there are 2k conditional probabilities. Keeping these facts in mind, consider 
the following: 

1.) The first method of encoding the image is to create a codebook for each of the states, using 
any of the above encoding methods, like Huffman encoding. This codebook would be 

79 
 



based on the conditional probabilities. This means that we will use p(sm+1{s0,s1,s2,...sm}) 
for given state meaning, for given values of s0 … sm, we will order the conditional 
probabilities for each of the 2k values of sm+1. Then based on these probabilities, we will 
create a codebook. After that we can find the actual pixel value and encode it with the 
required code corresponding to the codebook. There are two problems with this approach, 
firstly, we do not have knowledge of the conditional probabilities and secondly, the 
codebook would take up large amounts of memory to store as there 2k entries for each of 
the (2k)m states, which is (2k)m * 2k entries in the memory . 

2.) The first solution to this would be to not store the codebook, but to find the most probable 
value corresponding to each state, that is we are reduced to (2k)mentries in the memory 
required. Let this most probable value be ŷm and the actual pixel value be ym. Since this is 
most likely, most of the times ym- ŷm will be zero for each state. If not zero, for most states, 
these values will be close and hence the differences would have the same small values for 
every state. In fact, this expectation is met experimentally. 

3.) The problem of the lack of knowledge about the conditional probabilities still largely 
persists. Hence to calculate ŷm we instead use a technique which uses the fact that in a 
continuous tone image, neighbouring pixels have similar values. It is calculated using a 
method known as Differential Pulse Coding Modulation, which calculates ŷm as a linear 
combination of the neighbouring pixels.  

The quantity em = ym- ŷm is then encoded using various encoding techniques. It has been 
found experimentally that almost always, em follows a double sided Gaussian curve. This is to be 
expected as most of the values are going to be concentrated around 0. In fact the variation in a 
differential image is very low which makes it very easy to encode. 

Examples of images with these techniques applied are given below:

3.6.9.4 CCSDS – Multispectral and Hyperspectral Compression Algorithm [31] [34] 

With the required basics and reason behind the working of a basic prediction-encoding based 
compression algorithm, we are now in the position to briefly describe the CCSDS - Multispectral 
and Hyperspectral Compression Algorithm. 

Briefly, the algorithm proposes to first use a linear predictor on the image, the output of the 
predictor are “residuals”. These residuals are then encoded using Golomb-Rice Codes, which is 
typically the best encoding technique for encoding sources which have a double sided Gaussian 
distribution. Recall that hyperspectral images actually contain hundreds of sheets, each sheet is an 

83 
 



image taken in a different spectral range. In addition to using neighbouring pixels to predict the 
value of a pixel, in order to take advantage of spectral similarity, previous spectral band’s values 
of the corresponding pixel are also used to predict the value of the pixel. 

Before we talk about the algorithm in depth, we must first describe the format of the image that 
we receive from the camera. In our case the image is in BIL format, this stands for Band Interleaved 
by Line format. What this means is that first the first row of all the spectra will be written one after 
the other, then the second row of all the spectra and so on. This ordering has no impact on the 
efficiency of the compression algorithm. 

The following variables are used in the algorithm: 

The variable x is used to represent pixels along a certain row. 

The variable y is used to represent pixels along a certain column. 

The variable z is used to represent pixels in a certain spectral band. 

Hence, sz,y,x refers to the pixel value in the spectral band z, at the xth position in a row and the yth 
position in a column. 

Nx, Ny, Nz refer to the number of pixels in one row, the number of pixels in one column, and the 
number of spectral bands respectively. 

Each pixel is represented by D bits. smin = 0 , smax = 2D-1, smid = 2D-1 represent the minimum, middle 
and maximum possible values of pixel values or symbol values when the image is treated as a 
markov source. 

The variable t = y*Nx + x and basically gives the overall pixel number in a particular band, for 
example, if Nx is 12 respectively then the pixel with t = 100 is given by x = 4 & y = 8, assuming 
numbering starts from 0. Hence, given t, x = t mod Nx and y = [t/Nx], where [.] is the largest integer 
less than y.   

More variables will be introduced as and when encountered. 

Predictor: 

The input to the predictor is the sample value and the output is the residual. The residual is then 
sent to the entropy encoder. The original algorithm standard proposes two possible modes a full 
and a reduced mode. However, we will only be elaborating the full prediction method as it suits 
our needs more completely. The entire image can be converted into differential image in a single 
pass. 

This algorithm is essentially based on the Fast Lossless compression algorithm given in [35] and 
[36]. The original algorithm doesn’t make changes required for finite precision, integer arithmetic, 
however in our hardware based implementation, this is a huge concern. Hence, we will only be 
describing only the version suitable for hardware, the similar, albeit original version is available 
at [31]. 

Local Sum: 

We first define a local sum, as below: 

84 
 



 

Using ‘σ’ our original aim is to predict the values of the sample, and one would expect that we 
would be dividing the above values by 4. But, recall that we are trying to use only integer arithmetic 
and the effect of this will be nullified later to ensure correct scale of value of ŝ is obtained. 

See that, what we are essentially doing by local sum is using the pixels shown below: 

 

We are not using pixels which come after the sample, this is because we want to make it a single 
pass algorithm. 

Notice that all pixels do not have these values around them and hence we see two more entries for 
σ. Firstly, if the pixel belongs to the first row of any spectral band, σ will have to be approximated 
by using only the values to its left and to equalize the scale, the same value is added 4 times. 
Secondly, if the pixel belongs to the left-most column in any spectral band, we only have sz, y-1, x+1 
and sz,y-1,x with us, to equalize the scale each value is added twice. Lastly, if the pixel belongs to 
the last column in any spectral band, it only has sz,y-1,x, sz,y-1,x-1, sz,y,x-1 and hence to equalize the 
scale we need a value which is most likely to be similar to sz,y-1,x+1, which is sz,y-1,x, and hence this 
is added twice, as shown.  σ z,0,0 is not defined as it is not used. 

But we can’t simply use σ because then we wouldn’t be incorporating the spectral aspects to 
predict the value. To do this we first introduce local differences. 

Local differences: 

 

 

85 
 



Central local difference: 

For all pixels that σ exists, central difference is defined as: 

dz,y,x = 4sz,y,x – σz, y, x 

Directional local differences: 

 

 

The aim is to get as close to the actual value as possible so that most of the time the difference 
comes out to be zero. Consider the following: 

 4sz,y,x = σz,y,x + d, where d is the is the difference.  

 d= 4sz,y,x - σz,y,x 

Hence, 4sz,y,x = σz,y,x + (4sz,y,x - σz,y,x) 

If the ‘d’ could be approximated as closely as possible, then σz,y,x + d can get closer to 4sz,y,x. 
Hence, we try to estimate ‘d’ and then add this approximate value to the current predicited value 
to make it even more accurate. 

To estimate d, we use the local difference of corresponding values of pixels belonging to previous 
spectral bands (using spectral similarities) and we use the local difference of the current spectral 
band. 

The first question we need to answer is the number of values from previous spectra which will be 
used. This is a trade-off between accuracy and amount of memory required to store the data. 

We define variables, 0<P<15 and P* = min(z, P). P*essentially determines the number of spectral 
bands being used for a particular pixel.  

Hence, we make a local difference vector of size P* + 3, given as below: 

86 
 



 

To get the value of d, we first define a weight vector which give the coefficients of the different 
difference values which will be used in the linear prediction of d. 

 

Here, ω represents the weight corresponding to the difference, d.  ω is stored in a register of Ω+3 
bits, where 4≤Ω≤19. There is again a trade-off here, which is discussed in the original algorithm. 

There are two processes involved with the weights, initialization and updating, the updating 
process is based on the sign algorithm described in detail at [31], [34]. Weight updating allows us 
to make the prediction increasingly accurate and the weights are updated using the sign of the 
difference between actual and predicted value. Here we only give the required formulae for weight 
initialization. Though originally, there are custom and default weight initialization techniques, we 
will initially describe only default weights. 

Weight Initialization: 

ω (1)
z (1) = ⅞*2Ω 

ω ( i )(1) = [⅛*ω ( i − 1)
z z (1)] , i = 2,3,..., P z * . Here, [.] refers to greater integer less than it. 

87 
 



The weight updating algorithm uses the sign of the difference between the predicted sample and 
the actual sample value and hence will will first talk about the prediction part of the algorithm. 

For the prediction aspect of the algorithm, we need to define a few functions, which are specific 
to the hardware implementation. 

 

Here, R is the size of the register in which x is being stored. The above equation is a result of the 
natural result of storing a number in two’s complement form with the probability of there being 
overflow. Let us show this with an example, let R = 4, hence, typically R can store -8 to 7 in 2’s 
complement format.  

Let us first try to store a number which lies in this range, say 6.  

x+ 2R-1 = 6 + 8 = 14 

14 mod 16 = 14 

14 - 8 = 6, hence we get back the original number. 

In fact, for any number getting stored in a register of size R without overflow, that is, lying between 
-2R-1 and 2R-1-1, at most x + 2R-1< 2R and hence, (x+ 2R-1) mod 2R is essentially x+ 2R-1, when 2R-1 
is subtracted from it, we get back x. 

Now, though unlikely, let us imagine, that we have a number which lies outside this range, say 10.   

x+ 2R-1 = 10 + 8 = 18 

18 mod 16 = 2 

2 - 8 = -6, 

2’s complement representation of -6 = (1’s complement of 0110) + 1 = 1001+1 = 1010 

2’s complement representation of 10 = 01010 

The overflow is 0 and the value of the register storing x is the same. 

 

The clip function essentially ensures that x lies between xmin and xmax. 

Final Outputs: 

We now define a quantity, called the scaled predicted sample value (šz(t)), which has a scale double 
the actual predicted value, but again, recall, these scalings are done to ensure integer arithmetic. 

88 
 



 

Here,  

 

Which is essentially the weighted linear sum of the local differences to get one difference value. 

Even though the expression of šz(t) seems complicated, it can be easily simplified. Assume, that 

 is small enough to lie in the register of size R, then we can remove 
mod *

R . Hence we get 

 

Assume that the expression inside the Box function is indeed an integer, in that case, we get 

 

This is exactly what we had originally wanted. It may seem that dz is not the same skill because of 
the 2Ω, but recall that when we were initializing the weights, we had multiplied the weights with 
2Ω, and dividing this by 2Ω+1 will again give us a number of the same scale. Recall, once again, 
that these multiplications are done in order to ensure integer arithmetic. 

So basically we have the predicted value (σz) plus the predicted difference (dz), this is expected to 
give us a value close to the actual value. The additional 1 simply shifts the most probable value 
and is not a reflection of the logic behind the algorithm. 

We can now define the final predicted sample value, notice that the scaled predicted sample value 
(šz(t)) still has a scale of double the sample value. Hence, we define the predicted sample value 
(ŝz(t)) as 

 

89 
 



The reason for defining the šz(t) is so that we can use the sign of the difference between 2sz(t) and 
šz(t) in the sign algorithm. The sign algorithm is used for updating weights and the exact formulae 
can be found at [31], [34]. 

We are now in a position to define the mapped prediction residual (δz(t)) which will be entropy 
encoded. 

We first define, the prediction residual (Δz(t)): 

 

We would expect that this would be used directly for entropy encoding, but that is not the case. 
Since entropy encoding requires the quantities to be encoded to be positive, the following steps 
are taken. [34] We need to define another quantity θz(t), as: 

 

Now, we define the final output value: 

 

This is the output of the prediction part of the algorithm. Since output of the predictor is expected 
to follow Gaussian Curvature, it is suggested that Golomb encoding be used. We have briefly 
described Golomb encoding below. During the prediction process, the number of times a particular 
residual value occurs is recorded, this data is going to be used for encoding process as those 
residuals occurring more number of times are represented by smaller lengths of code. This was 
done in the case of Lena as well and can be seen above. The prediction process ensures that the 
number of times a value occurs, is decreased as most of the residuals are clumped at the center of 
the double sided Gaussian curve as was seen in the case of Lena and Boots. 

Entropy Encoding: 

Golomb encoding gives best results for sources which have a probability distribution similar to a 
Gaussian distribution. It involves a parameter ‘M’ and two other encoding techniques, Unary and 
Truncated Binary encoding. The symbols of the source are first ordered in the descending order of 
their probabilities, with the the symbol having the highest probability being treated as the number 
zero and the numbers being incremented sequentially. Hence, we have mapped the symbols of our 
source to the numbers 0 to N-1, if there are N symbols. Now we have a source with symbols 0, 
1, ..., N-1 and the same probabilities as the original source. 

Now for encoding, the symbols we divide each symbol by ‘M’, the quotient is then encoded using 
Unary encoding and the remainder is encoded using Truncated Binary encoding.  

We will explain the two encoding techniques, first: 

 

 

90 
 



Unary Encoding: 

This is a very simple technique and results in a prefix and self-synchronizing code which provides 
ease of decodability and error protection. The following are the codes for say, 10 symbols: 

0 1 

1 01 

2 001  

3 0001 

4 00001 

5 000001 

6 0000001 

7 00000001 

8 000000001 

9 0000000001 

Truncated Binary Encoding: 

This encoding technique also results in prefix codes. Let us assume that ‘n’ symbols need to be 
encoded and 2k ≤ n < 2k+1, let u = 2k+1 - n. Let, the codes written using ‘i’ bits be written in ascending 
order be called the “list-i”. Now, the first ‘u’ symbols are written using the first ‘u’ symbols of list-
k and the last ‘n-u’ symbols are written using the last ‘n-u’ symbols of list-k+1. This explanation 
will become clearer, with the example below: 

Let the symbols be 0,1,2,3,4,5. Hence, n=6, 22 ≤ 6 < 23, k = 2 and u = 2. 

List-2  List-3 

00  000  

01  001 

10  010 

11  011 

  100 

  101  

  110 

  111 

Hence, we encode as below: 

0  00 

1  01 

2  100 

3  101 

91 
 



4  110 

5  111 

Golomb Encoding: 

We will now give an example with Golomb Encoding with parameter M be 6 and let there be the 
following symbols: 
Symbol  Quotient  Remainder  Unary Binary 

0   0   0   1 00 

1   0   1   1 01 

2   0   2   1 100 

3   0   3   1 101 

4   0   4   1 110 

5   0   5   1 111 

6   1   0   01 00 

7   1   1   01 01 

8   1   2   01 100 

9   1   3   01 101 

10   1   4   01 110 

11   1   5   01 111 

12   2   0   001 00 

13   2   1   001 01  

14   2   2   001 100 

15   2   3   001 101  

16   2   4   001 110 

17   2   5   001 110 

 

Clearly, the overall codes are smaller and prefix codes, of course the space plays no role in being 
encoded and is only for representation over here. Observe that M has an effect on the compression 
ratio and there are methods used to decide the ideal value for the parameter. 

Results: 

We have not yet implemented the algorithm on our own, however [34] gives an overview of the 
results achieved by various implementations and in fact they have presented a comparative study, 
comparing this algorithm with earlier existing standards. There are two important judging criteria 
w.r.t to implementation, one is the compression rate represented in terms of the bits per sample 
and the other is the time taken to compress the image. 

92 
 



We will be implementing the algorithm on an FPGA fabric. A low-complexity implementation of 
the above algorithm was implemented by Santos et al. [6] with the sample-adaptive encoding like 
done above, as opposed to block encoding which involves taking multiple symbols in one go. 
Synthesis results were obtained on a space-qualified RTAX1000S and a Virtex-5 XC5VFX130. 
The compression IP has an occupancy of 34 percent of the RTAX1000S with a maximum 
frequency of 43 MHz, resulting in a throughput of 4 MSamples/sec. When synthesized in a Virtex-
5 XC5VFX130, it results in very low device utilization (2 percent of Slice LUTs). The maximum 
frequency of this implementation is 134 MHz, which yields a throughput of 11.30 MSamples/sec 
for a configuration with P = 3 and BSQ compression order. [34] 

The table [34] below compares the performance of the current algorithm with other algorithms 
when applied to a variety of images. Almost always, the compression provided by CCSDS is better. 
Notice, the best performance is represented in green. 

Below the performance comparison, one can also find the bits per sample for the original image, 
clearly CSDS gives compression ratios of almost 2 to 3 times, even 4 times sometimes (CRISM-
MSP).

3.6.10 Attitude Determination and Control System Algorithms 

To keep the satellite stable it is necessary to keep the satellite’s attitude in check and perform 
required maneuvers to correct the same. The On-Board Computer is responsible for collecting 
data from various aforementioned ADCS sensors, use them to determine the attitude and 
implement the required control algorithms to determine the required actuator action to obtain the 
required attitude.  
The OBC does the following tasks in conjunction with the ADCS: 

 Post deployment detumbling mode: 
o The first task that the OBC undertakes is the implementation of high-frequency B-dot.  
o In this mode the data is collected at very high frequencies from the IMU/Magnetometers 
and appropriate action is taken to detumble the satellite until its angular velocity reaches 
within a certain pre-defined limit.  
o This limit is defined on the basis of the fact that under normal conditions we want the 
satellite to be in Thompson spin.   

 In a normal mode, the OBC will communicate in the following way with the ADCS: 
o It will collect the following data in the form of housekeeping: 

■ Sun-sensor readings will be used to calculate the sun vector 

■ Magnetometer readings will give data for the local magnetic field. 

■ IMU readings are obtained which include the angular velocity. 

■ Temperature sensor readings are obtained 

94 
 



o Sun vector and local magnetic field values will be used to determine the attitude of the 
satellite. The TLE data obtained in the last uplink will be used to determine the orbital 
location of the satellite using Simplified General Perturbation (SGP) models, which will be 
running on the OBC software. 
o The measured angular velocity is compared with the threshold angular velocity and if the 
measured value exceeds the threshold by a certain predefined margin the actuators are fired 
else it stays idle. The actuators supply a torque based on the magnetometer reading. Here the 
actuators used are only the magnetorquers. 
o Notice here that B-dot is run at the same frequency as that at which housekeeping is 
collected. This is low-frequency B-dot. 
 Prior to clicking a photo or undertaking a downlink/uplink, the satellite will have to be 

pointed in a certain direction. All other power consuming processes will be shut down 
and the following steps will be followed: 

o First values are taken from the sun-sensors, IMU and magnetometers at a frequency much 
higher than housekeeping frequency. 
o These values will be used as inputs for the extended Kalman filter, which will output the 
estimate of the attitude. 
o This estimated attitude will be used to estimate the required torque to obtain preferred 
position. The above task is undertaken in a controlled loop. 
o The required torque is supplied by the reaction wheels because of the high precision and 
higher angular acceleration requirements.  
 In order to execute MPPT, sun-pointing needs to be done. For the same the following 

steps will be undertaken: 
o Data will be taken from the sun-sensors, IMU and magnetometers, again at a much higher 
frequency than normal housekeeping. 
o As above, this data will be used to estimate required torque to continuously keep the 
satellite pointing towards the sun. The same will be done using pointing algorithms different 
from B-dot. 
o Here, however magnetorquers will be used to undertake MPPT, not reaction wheels. 
 Emergency Detumbling: If the angular velocities measured during the housekeeping 

indicate that the satellite is tumbling, the system enters emergency detumbling mode, 
wherein, once again the angular velocity is collected more frequently and B-Dot is 
implemented more frequently, as in the first case.  

 Timely desaturation of the reaction wheels will also be undertaken as and when required. 
 

3.6.10.1 Attitude determination algorithm 

The final step for attitude determination system consists of estimating the attitude of the satellite 
from the sensor data. In general, the attitude estimation algorithms can be divided into two 
categories: 1) Deterministic estimation methods and 2) Recursive estimation methods. 
The deterministic methods consist of estimating the rotation matrix for calculating the attitude of 
the satellite by using at least two nonlinear measurement vectors and their corresponding 
reference vectors. The problem boils down to solving the Wahba’s problem. Examples for the 
same include the q-method, TRIAD, QUEST (used by COMPASS-1 picosatellite) etc. The 
recursive methods also use the dynamic models and/or rate measurements of the orientation 
along with the sensor measurements to recursively determine the attitude of the satellite. 

95 
 



Examples for these include the Extended Kalman filter (EKF) (used by CanX-2 and RAX), 
Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) (used by AAUSAT-3) etc. 
The attitude determination system of our satellite aims at using deterministic as well as recursive 
methods to determine the attitude of the satellite. Multiple sensor inputs will be combined using 
the EQUEST algorithm to give the optimal quaternion for the attitude of the satellite. The rate 
measurements along with the dynamic and kinematic models would then be combined with the 
quaternion output using the EKF to give the optimum estimate for the attitude of the satellite.  

3.6.10.2 Attitude Estimation using Extended Kalman Filter 

Attitude estimation in spacecraft refers to the process of estimating the state of the satellite (i.e. 
the orientation of the satellite with respect to an inertial frame and its rate of change) based on 
the sensor measurements which can be noisy. The state estimation using EKF tries to find the 
best estimate of the state using kinematics and/or dynamics models along with measurements 
that are both corrupted with random noise. 
The general continuous time EKF can be given as below - 

𝑋́ = 𝑓(𝑋, 𝑈) + 𝑊 
𝑍 = 𝐻(𝑋) + 𝑉 

Here X is the state vector, U is the control input to the system and Z is the measurement vector. 
W and V represent the process noise vector and measurement noise vector, both of which are 
assumed to be zero mean Gaussian noise with covariance of Q and R respectively. f and H 
represent the nonlinear functions in general. 
The filter starts with basic initial estimate of the state and then recursively calculates the state 
vector based on the knowledge of the noise characteristics, system dynamics and measurements 
obtained from the sensors. The filter in essence, linearizes the nonlinear dynamics of the satellite 
around the last state estimate. Hence for the approximation to be valid, the linearization should 
be a good approximation of the nonlinear model in all the uncertainty domains. Otherwise there 
is a possibility for the filter to diverge. 

3.6.10.3 The Discrete Kalman Filter 

For computational purposes, the discrete version of the Kalman filter is required which works 
with the matrix forms of the vectors and dynamics involved. The equations for the same are 
given below: 

𝑋𝑘 = 𝑓(𝑋𝑘−1, 𝑈𝑘−1) + 𝑊𝑘−1 
𝑍𝑘 = ℎ(𝑋𝑘) + 𝑉𝑘−1 

The random vector 𝑋0 is the initial state with known mean 𝜇0 = 𝐸(𝑋0) and covariance 𝑃0 =
𝐸[(𝑋0 − 𝜇0)(𝑋0 − 𝜇0)𝑇] 
Here the uncertainties in the model are taken care of by the model error vector 𝑊𝑘 and those in 
the measurement by the measurement noise vector 𝑉𝑘. Both of which are zero mean, random 
uncorrelated noises with covariance 𝑄𝑘 and 𝑅𝑘 respectively.  

Step 1: Initialize 

X̂0 = μ0 =  E(X0) 

P0 =  E[(X0 − μ0)(X0 − μ0)T] 

Step 2: Forecast 

96 
 



Assumption: The previous optimal estimate X̂k−1 with covariance P̂k are available. The priori 
estimate of the state (i.e. the predicted state before measurements) can be given as- 

X̂−
k =  f(X̂k−1, Uk−1) 

And the predicted error covariance becomes- 

P̂−
k =  Fk−1 ∗ P̂k−1 ∗ F T

k−1 +  Qk−1 

Here Fk−1 is the Jacobian of f(Xk−1, Uk−1) resulting from linearizing the function aroundX̂k−1 

∂f
Fk−1 =  (X̂ , U ) 

∂x k−1 k−1

Step 3: Update 

Now the measurements are available and the best estimate for the current state can be obtained as 
below- 

X̂k =  X̂−
k + K −

k[Zk −  h(X̂k )] 

Kk =  P̂−
k ∗ H T −

k (Hk ∗ P̂− 1
k ∗ H T

k + Rk)  

P̂k = (I −  Kk ∗ Hk) P̂−
k  

Here, 

1) X̂k is the updated state estimate. 
2) Kk is the Kalman gain. 
3) Hk is the observation matrix and is the Jacobian of h(Xk) resulting from linearizing the 

function aroundX̂−
k . 

∂h
Hk =  (X̂−) 

∂x k

4) P̂k is the updated covariance estimate. 

3.6.10.4 Attitude Control Algorithms 

The control algorithms that will be used onboard include the B-dot control law and other pointing 
control laws which are under developmental stage. These algorithms would be designed and tested 
on Matlab. Simulation of the orbit will also be done on the Matlab.  

The current status and the simulation results for the B-dot law and pointing controller are given 
below:  

B-Dot Detumbling Controller 

B-dot detumbling controller is one of the most used detumbling controller for small satellites. It is 
simple, robust and reliable. The fact that it uses only magnetometer reading and magnetic actuation 
to detumble the satellite, makes it our first choice. It has also been successfully tested and used 
onboard various satellites. [37] 

 

 

97 
 



The Need for Control Law: 

The separation of the satellite from a launch interface like the standard P-POD will subject the 
satellite to fairly significant torques which may be regarded as very short term high level 
disturbance torques that occur only once in the lifetime of the satellite, at the very beginning of the 
mission. As a result of these torques, the satellite will experience a tumbling motion; in this context 
the term ‘tumbling’ refers to sizeable and undesired rotational velocities.  

These uncontrolled body rates must be dissipated before the use of payload, in our case a 
hyperspectral camera, to get clear, undisturbed and focused image of the earth. B-dot control law 
accomplishes the same by using 3-axis magnetometer information only. 

The Basic Idea: 

As the satellite travels around the earth, the magnetic field experienced by it changes with time. 
The onboard magnetic field measurement may also changes if there is some change in the 
orientation of the satellite. 

The change due to the movement of the satellite around the earth can be found out using various 
magnetic models of the earth. We will be using the highly reliable and the recently updated 
International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF - 12) Model. [38] The difference of these 
readings and the changes in the Magnetometer readings will provide us with the change in the 
magnetic field due to the change in orientation of the satellite. 

The idea is to use this change as a feedback source. If the measured magnetic flux density does not 
change with time any more, the satellite is therefore not spinning around any longer with respect 
to the orbit frame and hence the body has been detumbled. The aim of this controller is to minimize 
the change of magnetic field density with time, and as a result, reduce the rotation of the satellite 
with respect to the orbit frame.  

The rate of change of the magnetic flux density, i.e. its time derivative, is notated as𝐵̇, and hence 
the name of the Controller. 

According to this, the magnetic moment produced will be proportional to the rate of change of 
the magnetic field. 

𝑚 = 𝐶 ∙ 𝐵̇ 

Where C is the B Dot controller gain which is calculated through simulations and needs to be 
determined for the satellite. As an initial estimate, C was found to be (6000, 6000, 6000) as per 
iterative simulations done by AAUSAT 3.  

The derivation for the control law and its stability analysis is given in Appendix B. 

Concept: 

A magnetometer on board the satellite measures the magnetic field vector in the body frame of the 
satellite. This magnetic field vector changes primarily due to two reasons - variations in magnetic 
field strength of the earth and tumbling of satellite. However, the magnetic field changes caused 
by tumbling of the satellite is much more dominant, because the tumbling rate of the satellite can 
be much larger than the orbital rate. This change in magnetic field due to tumbling of the satellite 
is called B Dot. However, there is some noise in this measurement which may lead to wrong 
actuation. Hence, a low pass filter is used to reduce the noise content from the measurements. 

98 
 



The Filter for Magnetometer Readings: 

The control law uses readings from the magnetometer to find the change in Magnetic Field. 
However, the onboard magnetometer, as any other man made instrument, is not ideal and has 
discrepancy in its readings. This can be due to inadequate accuracy or random noise. Therefore a 
filter will be used by the control law to decrease the random error introduced and get an estimate 
of the true magnetometer reading. We use a standard Low Pass Filter. [39] 

𝐵̂ 𝜔𝑐
𝐻(𝑠) =   =   

𝐵 𝑠 +  𝜔𝑐

Which when written in discrete time domain, becomes 

𝐵̂𝑘 =  𝑎1 𝐵̂𝑘−1 + 𝑎2 𝐵𝑘 

𝑎1 + 𝑎2 = 1 

Where 𝐵̂𝑘 is the filtered value of Magnetic field𝐵𝑘, at sample k. The values of 𝑎1 and 𝑎2 depends 
on the cutoff frequency. The value of 𝑎1  lies between 0 and 1. The value of 𝑎2 is as described by 
the above equation. For a low pass filter, the value of 𝑎1 is higher than 0.5. 

Hence using 𝑎1 and𝑎2, 𝐵̂𝑘 can be estimated easily. The value of 𝐵̇ can then be calculated using: 

𝐵̂𝑘 − 𝐵̂𝑘−1
𝐵̇𝑘 =   

𝑡𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝

Where 𝑡𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝 is the time between successive magnetometer readings i.e. the Sampling Time. 
 

Implementation of the Filter: 

The explained Low-pass filter was successfully implemented in MATLAB. 

 The actual maximum percentage error in the magnetometer readings is unknown because 
of unavailability of the sensor. However an estimated percentage error of 0.5 to 4 % was 
assumed and simulations were run for these values. The altitude of the satellite was 
assumed to be 600 km. 

The summary of the results is hereby presented:  

S. No. Maximum Percentage Error Altitude of the Filter Coefficient Filter Coefficient 
in Magnetometer readings Satellite (a1) (a2 = 1 – a1) 

1. 0.5% 600 km 0.740 0.260 

2. 1% 600 km 0.823 0.177 

3. 2% 600 km 0.881 0.119 

4. 2.5% 600 km 0.898 0.102 

99 
 



5. 3% 600 km 0.910 0.090 

6. 4% 600 km 0.924 0.076 

  Total 5.176 0.824 

  Mean 0.863 0.137 

 

The mean value of filter coefficient (a1) was found to be 0.863.  

 The actual altitude of the satellite is unknown until an orbit is designated to it. However an 
initial estimate of 450 to 800 km (Low Earth Orbit) was assumed and simulations were run 
for these values. The Maximum percentage error in magnetometer readings was assumed 
to be 2.5%. 

The summary of the results is hereby presented:  

S. No. Altitude of the Maximum Percentage Error Filter Coefficient Filter Coefficient 
Satellite in Magnetometer readings (a1) (a2 = 1 – a1) 

1. 450 km 2.5% 0.898 0.102 

2. 500 km 2.5% 0.900 0.100 

3. 550 km 2.5% 0.898 0.102 

4. 600 km 2.5% 0.897 0.103 

5. 650 km 2.5% 0.900 0.100 

6. 700 km 2.5% 0.899 0.101 

7. 800 km 2.5% 0.897 0.103 

     

 

The value of filter coefficients changes very slightly with the altitude of the satellite. The analysis 
verified that the filter coefficients are independent of the Altitude of the satellite. 

The filter performed well at the determined filter coefficients and was able to reduce noise from 
the test values effectively. 

100 
 



Ideal Implementation of the Control Law 

Initial Conditions: 

The initial condition, i.e. the initial tumbling rates at the beginning of mission, are governed by the 
P-POD separation and the deployment of the communication antennae. Typical Cubesat designs 
estimate a maximum expected tumbling rate upon P-POD release of 0.1 rad/sec on all three body 
axes. Adding a margin of safety of 50% as well as the impact of antenna release, yields an 
estimated 0.2 rad/sec in x, 0.25 in y and 0.2 in z axis respectively, resulting in an overall tumbling 
motion in excess of 3 revolutions per minute as initial condition. 

Initial Tumbling Rate 𝜔𝑜 (-0.2 , 0.25 , 0.2)T rad s-1 

Initial Tumbling |𝜔𝑜| 0.3775 rad s-1 

3.605 rev/min 

 

For ideal implementation, no external torque was considered to be acting on the satellite. A polar 
circular orbit at altitude 600 km was used for this particular implementation. 

Controller Gain: 

The scalar gain of the detumbling control law determines the rate at which energy is dissipated. 
Generally, the higher the gain, the faster will be the dissipation of kinetic energy and the higher 
will be the actuator load. In order to determine a reasonable detumbling gain, a design strategy is 
employed, which selects the control gain C in such a way that coil saturation can be excluded by 
design. The achievable magnetic moment is finite for a given coil design. Our satellite will be 
capable of producing a maximum magnetic moment of approximately 0.2847 Am² at full actuator 
load in a single direction. 

It is sensible to assume that the maximum rate of change of the magnetic field occurs at the initial 
point of the detumbling maneuver at which |ω| = 0.4 s-1. At a conservative minimum orbit altitude 
of 600km the largest B vector occurs at the magnetic poles with a magnitude of 4.65 x 10-5 T. The 
detumbling gain C may be chosen according to the following conservative condition which is 
stated as a direct consequence of the control law. 

𝑚𝑚𝑎𝑥
|𝐶| ≤  

𝜔𝑜 ∙ 𝐵𝑚𝑎𝑥

With the above assumptions the magnitude of the detumbling gain should be limited to 15306.5 
Am²s/T. In order to alleviate the conservativeness of the assumptions leading to this value, the 
gain is rounded up to an even C = -15000 Am²s/T for the presented implementation. 

First order Low-pass Filter: 

The magnetometer reading was simulated by introducing random errors in the true readings and 
the proposed filter was used to implement the control law. The filter coefficient of 0.863, which 
was determined in the previous section, was used to implement the low pass filter. 

Results: 

101 
 



As depicted in the graph, the Angular velocity of the satellite was decreased to under 0.01 rad s-1 
in each axis in under 50,000 iterations (i.e. about two orbit period) by using the control law. The 
angular velocity continued to have decreasing trend after that and approached almost zero. The 
final exit state was found to be:  

𝜔𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 = (−0.0019976663 , −0.0000204341 , 0.0003577060)𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑠−1

Other Results 

 

Figure 70 Control Torque generated in each axis vs Number of Iterations 
The optimized controller gain assured that the value of magnetic moment generated in each axis 
was well below the maximum possible magnetic moment along with assuring early detumbling. 
The B Dot Control Law was therefore verified to be very robust w.r.t. parameter uncertainties and 
effective in detumbling the satellite in Ideal conditions. 

Realistic Implementation of the B Dot Control law is still to be performed. 

3.6.10.6 Pointing Controller 

In pointing control, the satellite shall point towards a given reference attitude or track a given 
reference by renewing the reference quaternion. This will enable the satellite to point the 
antennas towards the ground station for better communication link. It will also enable the 
satellite to point the maximum projected area towards the sun for maximum power generation in 
case of sun pointing. Various control strategies are available for maneuvering the satellite to 
achieve the given objective. For faster slew rates, reaction wheels would be used as control 
actuators as in the case of camera pointing. While for detumbling and momentum dumping, 
magetorquers would be used as the actuators.  

Concept: 

Feedback methods would be used for the attitude tracking application. The controller would be 
model based and would require complete knowledge of the satellite’s attitude. The specific 
controller design would be based on the pointing and jitter tolerance requirements of the satellite. 
Development in control area is yet to be done. But a simple sliding mode controller could be 
developed.  

103 
 



Assuming quaternion parameterization, the difference between the present angular velocity and 
commanded angular velocity could be used to get the sliding surface vector for a sliding mode 
controller- 

𝑠 = (𝜔 − 𝜔𝑐) + 𝑘𝛿𝒒 
Where 
𝜔𝑐is the commanded angular velocity, 𝑘 is a constant and 𝒒 is the vector part of the quaternion. 
The control law could be derived as- 

 Take time derivative of 𝑠 -  
𝑠̇ = (𝜔̇ − 𝜔𝑐̇ ) + 𝑘𝛿𝒒̇ 

 Substitute 𝛿𝒒̇  -  
1 1

𝛿𝒒̇ = ∗ 𝛿𝑞(𝜔 − 𝜔 )  ∗ 𝛿
2 𝑐 + 𝒒 ∗ (𝜔 + 𝜔

2 𝑐) 

 Where q is the scalar part of the quaternion 
 Use Euler’s rotational equation of motion given by –  

𝐽 ∗ 𝜔̇ = −𝜔 ∗ 𝐽𝜔 + 𝐿 
Where L is the control law.  

 Substitute both in the time derivative of 𝑠 and with the time derivative of Lypunov 
function requiring 𝑠̇ = 0, one can derive the equivalent control law to be - 

𝑘
𝐿 = 𝐽 [ {𝛿𝑞(𝜔 − 𝜔) 𝛿𝒒 ∗ (

2 𝑐 −  𝜔 + 𝜔𝑐)} + 𝜔̇𝑐] + 𝜔 ∗ 𝐽𝜔 

The control law provides the sliding mode attitude tracking law, but it is not guaranteed to 
maneuver the satellite along the shortest distance. Modification to the law could be made to 
account for this and also the noise and an application specific controller needs to be designed. 
 
 

3.7 Attitude Determination and Control System 

The ADCS, Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem has, as its name suggests, the 
responsibility of making sure that the satellite has the correct attitude in space and correct any 
deviation from the expected attitude. 

The ADCS module will be designed in house. Certain sensors on board (the magnetometers and 
the IMU) will be procured from outside but the design and layout of the components, including 
the interface between them will be done in house.  

 
The task can be divided into: 
 Initial Acquisition: This refers to the detumbling of the satellite which brings the attitude of 

the satellite into a predefined set of conditions. The initial acquisition can also be used as a 
safe mode function. 

 Operation: A more precise control of the satellite’s attitude which is payload and system 
dependent.  

The operational functions of the ADCS may also be divided into sub functions: 
o Attitude Determination - Sensor(s) 
o Attitude Control - Actuator(s) 
o Data Handling Unit for processing sensor data and control of actuators. 

104 
 



3.7.1 Functional requirements of the system  

The requirement of the ADCS is defined by the mission objective and the proper functioning of 
other subsystems on the satellite.  
1. DETUMBLING - Detumbling is the process of stabilizing the angular rate of the satellite 
after orbital insertion in order to increasing the pointing accuracy after placing on orbit by the 
rocket. 
2. CAMERA POINTING- Pointing with the precision required to operate a narrow-swath 
camera system. This requires pointing down the satellite (Nadir Pointing) and assuring relatively 
small angular rate to achieve the determined resolution of the pictures. 
3. ANTENNA POINTING- Angular rate of the satellite cannot exceed the predetermined 
threshold, which may be caused due to external disturbance torques, in order to assure a stable 
communication link. 
4. ALIGN SOLAR PANEL TO GENERATE MAX. POWER- Optimal performance of the 
Electrical Power System requires pointing the solar panels to the Sun in order to get as much 
solar energy as possible. 
5. DETERMINATION OF ATTITUDE- Attitude determination is a meticulous process 
requiring complex algorithms and processing power in order to determine the attitude and the 
deviation from the expected attitude. 
6. ATTITUDE CONTROL- The attitude control is performed using actuators. It is the 
mechanism that alters the future state of the system. It consists of a group of devices that controls 
the behavior of the system. 

3.7.2 Requirement of ADCS and constraints 

 Power constraint: It should consume less than 4W during peak performance. 
 Pointing requirements: Pointing accuracy: 0.0250 
 Stability: Stability: +/- 10 

3.7.2.1 Orbit Propagator models 

The following models would be used for attitude determination and/or propagation: 

 SGP 4: The Simplified General Perturbations Satellite Orbit Model 4 (SGP4) is a model 
whose purpose is to predict the orbital position of the satellite at a specified time using the 
information from TLE. This model is mainly used for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. 
This model would be implemented on the processor on-board. 

 IGRF: The IGRF model estimates the magnetic field strength and direction at a given date, 
latitude, longitude and altitude, which are provided by the orbit propagator. By using the 
estimate of the position from the SGP4 and the IGRF model, it is possible to determine the 
magnetic field for the satellite's given position. 

 TLE: The data containing information about the satellite’s orbit is published in the Two 
Line Element (TLE) format, which also includes all the six modified orbital elements. The 
TLE format form consists of two lines, each with space for 69 characters.  

 Ephemeris: Ephemeris gives the positions of naturally occurring astronomical objects as 
well as artificial satellite in the sky at a given time or times. The astronomical object which 
has the largest effect on the satellite motion is the Earth, the Sun and the Moon. 

105 
 



 Sun position model: By using the estimate of the position from the SGP4 and the sun 
positioning model, it is possible to determine the expected position of the sun relative to the 
position of the satellite and thereby determine whether the satellite is in eclipse. 

 Albedo: Some of the sun-light that hits the Earth is reflected. This is called Earth albedo 
and it contributes to the power induced in solar cells and currents in sun sensors, just like the 
direct sun-light does. This produces an error in the estimation of sun vector. Therefore the 
Earth albedo model is implemented in order to have a decent estimation of the sun vector. 

3.7.3 Disturbance Modelling 

Disturbance torques are caused by the environment. They prevent the satellite from staying in a 
given orientation as seen from an inertial frame. They need to be modelled to take into account 
the maximum torques that can be encountered in an orbit and the actuators need to be designed 
accordingly. There are several different environmental disturbances which will act on the 
satellite while orbiting the Earth, most of them will be disturbance torques. Four disturbances are 
considered for the model. 

• Atmospheric drag 
• Radiation torque 
• Magnetic residual torque 
• Gravity gradient torque 

3.7.3.1 Atmospheric Drag 

The aerodynamic force depends on the atmospheric density ρ, the drag coefficient 𝐶𝑑, the surface 
area A and the satellite velocity V. We can assume 𝐶𝑑  to be 2.5 for the nanosatellite (we take a 
small margin from the value of 2.2 given in [Larson et al.]). The torque created by this 
disturbance can be computed using the following equation [4]:  

1
𝑇𝑎 = ∗ 𝜌 ∗ 𝐶 ∗ 𝐴 ∗ 𝑉2 (𝑐

2 𝑑 ∗ 𝑝𝑎 − 𝑐𝑔) 

The center of aerodynamic pressure 𝑐𝑝𝑎 can be approximated to the center of the cube, and the 
maximum distance between 𝑐𝑝𝑎 and 𝑐𝑔 is 7 cm according to the Cubesat specification for a 3U 
satellite. 

3.7.3.2 Solar radiation torque 

The satellite will be affected by the radiation hitting its surface. This will cause a torque around 
its center of mass. The major radiation sources in a LEO are direct solar radiation and solar 
radiation reflected by the earth and its atmosphere. 
The worst-case torque caused by solar radiation is 

𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑑 = 𝐹 ∗ (𝑐𝑝𝑎 − 𝑐𝑔) 
𝐹𝑠 ∗ 𝐴𝑠

𝐹 = ∗ (1 + 𝑞)𝑐𝑜𝑠𝛼 
𝑐

Where: 
• (𝑐𝑝𝑎 − 𝑐𝑔)is the difference between center-of-pressure and center-of-gravity  
• 𝐹𝑠 the solar constant 1, 367 W/m2 
• 𝐴𝑠is the surface area. 
• 𝑐 is the speed of light, 3x108 m/s. 

 

106 
 



The reflectance factor 𝑞 ranges from 0 to 1, depending on the absorbance and reflection of the 
surface of the satellite. 𝛼 is the angle of incidence of the Sun. 

3.7.3.3 Magnetic Residual torque 

Earth's magnetic field can be a disturbance when an undesired residual magnetic dipole is present 
on the satellite as it would cause undesirable torques. The residual dipole can be limited by 
placing wires properly and making them as short as possible. 
This disturbance is calculated by the formula [4]: 

𝐷 ∗ 2 ∗ 𝑀
𝑇𝑀𝑅 = 𝐷 ∗ 𝐵 =  

𝑅3

Where: 
• 𝑀 = 7.96 · 1015𝑇. 𝑚3 is the magnetic moment of the Earth. 
• 𝑅 = 7000 𝑘𝑚 is the radius of the orbit. 
• 𝐷 is the residual dipole. 

3.7.3.4 Gravity gradient torque 

Any non-symmetrical object in orbit is subjected to gravitational torque due to variation of 
earth’s gravitational force onto the object. This torque is given by the formula [4]: 

3 ∗ 𝜇
𝑇𝑔 = ∗ (𝑟 ∗ 𝐼𝑟) 

𝑟5

Where 𝑟 is the position vector in an earth-centered frame and 𝜇 is the earth gravity constant 
(3.986.1014 m3s-2). 
The calculated disturbance torque for our satellite with the above equations is given below: 

Table 21 Disturbance Modeling 

Disturbance torque Maximum Value (Nm) 
Atmospheric Drag 4.7 × 10−7 
Solar Radiation 4 × 10−9 
Magnetic Residual 5 × 10−9 
Gravity Gradient 8 × 10−6 

3.7.4 Satellite Kinematics 

The relation between the angular velocities and the attitude in the different coordinate systems is 
described by the kinematic equations. We can find the orientation of the satellite by integrating 
the angular velocities between the body and the inertial coordinates over time. After a short 
evaluation, we decided to use quaternion parameterization. The rate between the inertial and 
body coordinates expressed in quaternions is given below [4]: 

 
1

𝑞̇𝑜𝑏 = 𝑄 𝑞
2 𝑜𝑏 𝑜𝑏 

Where, 
 

0 𝜔𝑧 −𝜔𝑦 𝜔𝑥
−𝜔𝑧 0 𝜔

𝑄 𝑥 𝜔𝑦
𝑜𝑏 = [ 𝜔𝑦 −𝜔𝑥 0 𝜔 ] 

𝑧

−𝜔 −𝜔 𝜔
𝑥 𝑦 − 𝑧 0

107 
 



 
The angular velocities 𝜔𝑥, 𝜔𝑦 and 𝜔𝑧  that are given in  matrix 𝑄𝑜𝑏 are velocities about the axes 
of  𝐹𝑏 with respect to 𝐹𝑜, that is 𝜔𝑜𝑏. 
 
We can decompose the angular velocity of the body reference frame with respect to the inertial 
frame into angular velocities of the body with respect to the orbit frame and angular velocity of 
the orbit frame with respect to the inertial frame by the relation: 

𝜔𝑏
𝑖𝑏 = 𝜔𝑏

𝑖𝑜 + 𝜔𝑏
𝑜𝑏 

 
From this 𝜔𝑏

𝑜𝑏 can be expressed,

𝑜𝑏 = 𝜔𝑏

3.7.5 Satellite Dynamics 

Considering the satellite as a rigid body, we can write the angular momentum as  
ℎ = 𝐼𝜔 

Where, 
ω: rotational velocity of the body 
I: moment of inertia matrix  
 
Total torque acting on the body,𝜏 = [𝜏1 𝜏2 𝜏3]𝑇 is given by: 

𝑑
𝜏 = (𝐼𝜔) 

𝑑𝑡
When this torque is expressed in the body frame, relative to an inertial frame, such as the 
Earth Centered Inertial (ECI) frame for our case, we get the following equation [5], 

𝑑
𝜏𝑏 = (𝐼𝑏𝜔𝑏 𝜔𝑏 × 𝐼 𝜔

𝑑𝑡 𝑖𝑏) + 𝑏 𝑏
𝑖𝑏 ( 𝑖𝑏) 

The moment of inertia matrix is constant in the body frame, therefore, we get: 
𝜏𝑏 = 𝐼𝜔̇𝑏

𝑖𝑏 + 𝜔𝑏
𝑖𝑏 × (𝐼𝜔𝑏

𝑖𝑏) 

108 
 



We denote the moment of inertia matrix as I for simplicity. 
After rearranging the equation, we get, 

𝜔̇𝑏
𝑖𝑏 = 𝐼−1(−𝜔𝑏

𝑖𝑏 × (𝐼𝜔𝑏
𝑖𝑏) + 𝜏𝑏)  

 
We have expressed the dynamics of the satellite by its angular velocity (w.r.t. the inertial frame) 
time derivative. We can manipulate the satellite by changing its angular velocity with the means 
of control torque. 
Writing the equation in component form,

ω̇𝑦 = ((I
I z − I𝑥)ω𝑥ωz+ τ2 ) 

𝑦

ω̇𝑧 = ((I − I )ω
I x y yωx+ τ3 ) 

𝑧

 
The total torque 𝜏𝑏 is the sum of torques generated by the magnetorquer and the total disturbance 
torques. 

3.7.6 ADCS Configuration  

3.7.6.1 Sensor Configuration 

To determine a satellite’s attitude a variety of sensors are used. These sensors can be divided into 
two main categories, reference sensors and inertial sensors. Reference sensors measure the 
direction of a known vector e.g. the sun’s or earth’s magnetic field. Inertial sensors measure 
rotation and/or translational acceleration with respect to an inertial reference frame. 

3.7.6.2 Sensor Selection 

Various criteria such as resilience towards the harsh space environment, low power consumption, 
low weight and size, ease of implementation, accuracy and cost are considered for the sensor 
selection process. Star trackers and GPS antenna arrays are both very expensive and hard to fit 
within the size and the power constraints of a nanosatellite. This leaves us with a choice between 
magnetometers, sun or horizon sensors. A table depicting the various advantages and 
disadvantages of sensors is shown below-

Based on this analysis it was decided that sun sensors, magnetometers and an IMU consisting 
of gyroscopes and accelerometers will be used as sensors for our satellites. 

110 
 



3.7.6.3 Sun Sensors: 

We decided to use sun sensors as they have a small size, low mass, wide field of view, reliability, 
radiation tolerance, less expensive and give a rough estimate of the sun angle. A sun sensor 
reference model is needed to determine the attitude of the satellite from the available data. 
Concept: 
The sun sensor measures the relative position of the sun in the body frame of the satellite. The 
output of a photocell is an electric current/voltage directly proportional to the intensity of light 
falling on it along with the angle of attack. It is assumed that the sun is a point source. The 
amount of current is proportional to 𝐼(𝜃), where 
 

𝐼(𝜃) = 𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜃) 

Figure 71 
For a 3 dimensional case, assuming that 3 faces are lit up, the intensities on each face can be 
given as- 

𝐼1 = 𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜃1)𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜃3) 
𝐼2 = 𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜃2)𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜃3) 

𝐼3 = 𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜃3) 
 
 
 
 
 

111 
 



Figure 72 
 
Assuming that the sun shines on the x, y and negative z axis, one can obtain the sun vector as 
below- 

𝐼𝑥
1

𝑉𝐵
𝑆 = ( ) [ 𝐼𝑦 ] 

𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑥 −𝐼𝑧

This method gives a crude form of the sun vector. Other advanced methods like the conical shell 
model [6] and an advanced method [7] could be used to give a better estimate.

Based on the current analysis, we decided to use the sun sensor provided by SSBV. It consumes 
very less power (10mA) and has less mass compared to the other digital sensors (5 gms). 
Moreover, it also provides higher accuracy as compared to simple photodiodes. The sensor also 
determines the spacecraft body angles with respect to the sun.   
 
The following data was directly available from the data sheet [8]- 
The sensor consists of a CMOS PSD detector sitting behind a small pin‐hole with a field of view 
of +/‐ 57 degrees. The device produces four analogue voltages that are dependent on the incident 
angle of sunlight in the horizontal and vertical directions. Each sensor is supplied with a 
calibration algorithm that calculates the sun vector from these four voltages (and a reference 
voltage) to an accuracy of 0.5 degrees.

The sensor is shortlisted based on the available data and preliminary power and mass analysis. 
The price quotation and other details regarding the sensor are yet to be received. The final choice 
of the sensor will depend on the required accuracy and cost analysis. 

3.7.6.4 Magnetometers: 

Magnetometers are widely used in satellites as they are relatively small, inexpensive and 
lightweight. A magnetic field model like IGRF is required for attitude determination while the 
same is not required in the case of torque calculation for control. 
Concept: 
The magnetometers measure a sum of the local magnetic field that is of interest and also the 
local fields produced by the satellite. The readings could be disturbed due to the presence of 
magnetorquer coils, ferrous materials on board, and other residual magnetic fields. They have to 
be calculated and compensated for. 
Sensor selection: 
The following COTS sensors were evaluated for implementation:

3.7.6.5 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU): 

The inertial measurement gives the measure of the external forces and the angular rate of the 
satellite in body frame. The IMU is a combination of two type of sensors - the 3-axis gyroscopes 
that measure the angular rate of the satellite and 3-axis accelerometers that measure the 

115 
 



acceleration and hence the external forces on the satellite. Hence attitude information is available 
from the IMU in near continuous time.  
 
The gyroscope performance is rated primarily on two characteristics: the resolution and the 
noise. The resolution has to be smaller than the required angular rate knowledge. The gyroscope 
data will be used with the data from the reference vectors to gain the complete attitude 
knowledge of the satellite using the EKF. Moreover, the data from the IMU can be combined 
with magnetometer data for attitude estimation during eclipse time. The only problem with 
gyroscopes is that they have an initial bias and they tend to drift over time due to accumulated 
errors. This problem is resolved by the use of magnetometers and sun sensors to calibrate them 
periodically. The accelerometers will be used to gain the estimate of the periodic forces that act 
on the satellite. They could be explored further and put into orbit estimation as well.

3.7.7 Actuator Configuration 

3.7.7.1 Actuator Selection 

Satellite actuation is needed to attain a specific orientation for the mission or to stabilize the 
satellite against tumbling. For this, various kinds of techniques are used. They can be grouped 
under passive and active methods for stabilization.  
 
Available actuators: 

 Reaction Wheels: These utilize the concept of conservation of angular momentum and 
thus generating a torque, which affects the satellite in the opposite direction of the 
rotation. Reaction wheels can make very accurate adjustments, but may build up a 
significant momentum during the course of operation. Therefore they are often used with 
other actuators to dump momentum from the reaction wheels. Disadvantages of reaction 
wheels are that they have moving parts which can easily fail and have a high power 
consumption. 

 Magnetorquers: Magnetic torquers are often used in satellites for three-axis 
stabilization and angular momentum control. Magnetorquers are wound electromagnetic 
coils with or without a permeable metal core. On sending current through the coil, 
magnetic field will be generated perpendicular to the current loop. This magnetic field 
will interact with the earth's magnetic field generating a torque which acts on the satellite 
and rotates it. The advantages of magnetorquers are that they are relatively cheap, easy 
to make and have no moving parts, thus are more reliable. 

 Thrusters: Thrusters utilize the concept of action-reaction or Newton’s third law of 
motion by expulsion of propellant at high velocity in one direction, thereby causing the 
satellite to be pushed in the opposite direction with an equal force. They can generate 
both forces and torques, so they can be used for both trajectory control and attitude 
control. But it requires additional weight and space on-board the satellite in order to store 
the propellant used by the thrusters. The amount of propellant, stored onboard the 
satellite is limited and therefore limits the effective lifetime of the ACS. Thrusters are 
hence considered inappropriate as actuators. 

 Permanent Magnet: The permanent magnet works the same way as the magnetorquers 
i.e. magnetic field produced by the magnet interacts with earth’s magnetic field 
producing a torque which rotates the satellite until both the fields are aligned. However, 
they do not consume any power and can help ensure two axis stabilization for the entire 
lifetime of the satellite, if the satellite has been de-tumbled. The main disadvantages of 
using permanent magnets are that they cannot remove kinetic energy from the satellite, 
i.e. the permanent magnet cannot remove oscillations from the satellite, and the satellite 
cannot be controlled for pointing the satellite towards a given point on the earth. Hence it 
is not a suitable actuator for our satellite. 

 Gravity Boom: The gravity-gradient stabilization method utilizes the fact that the 
earth’s gravitational field is non-uniform. The satellite is stabilized around two axes by 
adding a gravity boom to the satellite or by making it long enough to take advantage of 
the gravity-gradient. The disadvantage of gravity boom is that it will take up vital space 
on-board a Cubesat, hence is inappropriate as actuators. 

 Spin-Stabilization: Stabilization of the satellite around two axes can be done by 
intentionally spinning the satellite rapidly around the third axis and utilizing the 

118 
 



gyroscopic effect created thereby. This method is undesirable as spinning the satellite 
around one axis will result in blurry image by the payload. Hence this is not fit as an 
actuator for our mission 

Based on the above analysis and the mission requirements magnetorquers and reaction wheels 
are selected as actuators for our satellite. 

Reaction wheels: 

Each axis of the satellite will have a reaction wheel for tri-axis control of the satellite. 
Concept: 
Due to the conservation of angular momentum, the torque delivered by a reaction wheel will be 
transferred to the satellite in the form of a torque of the same magnitude in the opposite direction. 

𝐿̇𝑅𝑊 = −𝐿̇𝑆 
Here L is the angular momentum. RW stands for the reaction wheel and S for the satellite. 
 
In order to determine and analyze the reaction wheel-satellite motion, one needs to determine the 
kind of maneuver that one has to perform. A particular kind of maneuver [11] could include a 
time over which a constant torque is applied by the reaction wheel assembly, then there is a time 
over which no torque is applied, followed by a time over which an opposing torque is applied. In 
this case, the total angular displacement of the satellite can be taken as the sum of angular 
displacements in each phase: 

𝜃𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 𝜃𝑎 + 𝜃𝑏 + 𝜃𝑐 
And the torque needed for the maneuver is [12]- 

𝑇 =  (𝜃𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 ∗ 𝐼/𝑡2)/[𝑛(1 − 𝑛)]  
Here n is a value from 0-0.5 and it indicates the percentage of time that the wheel will accelerate 
and decelerate. A value of 0.5 is a time optimal maneuver. I is the satellite’s moment of inertia. 
This torque is delivered by the reaction wheels- 

𝑇𝑅𝑊 = 𝐼 ∗ 𝛼 
Keeping into account that 𝜃́𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 𝛼 ∗ 𝑛 ∗ 𝑡

The reaction wheels supplied by the Hyperion technologies are chosen based on the small size, 
low mass and low power consumption. The maximum torque supplied would still be enough to 
slew the satellite along with magnetorquers on board. 
The following data was available from the data sheet directly [13] – 

Figure 76 Reactions wheels specifications

 The reaction wheels are shortlisted based on the available data and preliminary power 
and mass analysis. The price quotation and other details regarding the component are yet to be 
received. The final choice of the sensor will depend on the required accuracy and cost analysis. 
 
Accommodation study of Reaction wheels: 

According to the data available from the company and the placement of the components by 
mechanical subsystem, it was realized that 3 reaction wheels with the given specifications can be 
accommodated in the present structure of 3U satellite.  

While selecting the actuators for the satellite, it was found that reactions wheels provide quick 
maneuvering as well as capability of continuous high-accuracy pointing control. This is one of the 
prime requirements for the payload and so it was decided to use reaction wheels as actuators. But 
it is also a fact that they consume more power than magnetorquers. Also, while operating them as 
momentum wheels, the use of magnetorquers is required to desaturate them from time to time. 
Hence, it was decided to use magnetorquers for detumbling and desaturation of momentum wheels, 
while reaction wheels will be used during payload operation to provide accurate stability and 
control. 

However, the quantitative analysis of the attitude control and stability provided by this scheme is 
yet to be done. If the current scheme is not feasible due to some reasons, the team is still exploring 
the feasibility of configurations combining reaction wheels and magnetorquers. These 
configurations include: 

 One reaction wheel/momentum wheel along the camera axis and 3 magnetorquer coils 
along perpendicular faces. 

 Pitch momentum wheel (larger) and yaw reaction wheel along with yaw wheel desaturation 
electromagnet. 

However, feasibility study of these cases in terms of power and mass constraints is yet to be 
done. It is also not guaranteed that these configurations will perform in accordance with the 
payload requirements. The chosen scheme of 3 magnetorquers and 3 reactions wheels 
theoretically confirm 3 axis control and stability as per the payload requirements. 

3.7.8 Magnetorquer Details 

3.7.8.1 Design 

The torquer coils will be designed for all the three faces of the satellite. Design of the coils has to 
be such that it can counter the torque produced due to environmental disturbances as well as 
provide provide coarse pointing stability to the satellite. The estimation of the maximum external 
disturbance torque is tabulated below: 

Table 27 disturbance Torque 

Disturbance torque Maximum value (Nm) 

Atmospheric Drag 4.7×10-7 

Magnetic Residual 5×10-9 

Gravity Gradient 8×10-6 

121 
 



Solar Radiation 4×10-9 

Hence the total external disturbance torque turns out to be Ldist = 8.479×10-6 Nm. 

3.7.8.2 Calculation for Worst Case Scenario: 

Since the earth’s magnetic field can be easily compared to that of a bar magnet, its local magnetic 
field can be approximated to be: 

2 × 𝑀
𝐵 =   

𝑅3

Where M = 7.96 x 1015 Tm2, which is the magnetic moment of the earth; R = ~6978000 m, the 
radius of the orbit. Thus B = 4.6854378×10-5 T, the local magnetic field. 

The torque due to dipole moment m in magnetic field B can be shown to be: 

𝐿 = 𝑚𝐵𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 

Where 𝜃 is the angle between the moment and the field vectors. This torque can be averaged with 
the angle in an orbit period to be: 

𝜋
∫ 𝑚𝐵𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃𝑑𝜃

𝐿 0
𝑎𝑣𝑔 =   

𝜋

This average torque has to be equal to our required torque, thus m turns out to be: 

𝜋𝐿𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡
𝑚 =   

2𝐵

Upon calculation, the magnetic moment comes out to be m = 0.28426 Am2. 

This is the minimum magnetic dipole moment for overcoming the external disturbance torques. 

3.7.8.3 Selection of the Coil Material: 

While selecting the coil material, it is kept in mind that the maximum power consumption does 
not exceed 0.4W. The maximum area of the coil is limited by the area provided by the side panels. 
The maximum current that could be carried is limited by the power consumption requirement and 
the current carrying capacity of the wire. The number of turns for the wire is also limited by the 
volume available for the torquer coil. Keeping these constraints in mind, it is also desired that one 
should be able to generate sufficient torque to counteract the maximum disturbance torque.  

The procedure followed for selecting the coil material and the number of turns for each face is 
detailed below in various parts. 

The moment expression in terms of wire properties is given below: 

𝐴 𝑀𝑐𝑃
𝑚 =  √  

𝐶 𝜌𝑤𝜎𝑇

From the equation, one could infer that the product of density and specific resistivity should be 
minimum for maximum obtainable dipole moment. Aluminium turns out to have a smaller product 
compared to copper. But the problem that arises is that the minimum diameter of the aluminium 

122 
 



wires available are not less than 1.1mm, but the commercially available copper wires range from 
0.02mm to 0.4mm which fall under the desirable range for the coil wiring. This is because a larger 
wire diameter would mean a larger cross sectional area, and thus lower resistance as shown by the 
equations below: 

𝑁 ∙ 𝐶 ∙ 𝜎(𝑇)
𝑅 =   

𝑎𝑤

𝜎(𝑇) =  𝜎𝑜(1 +  𝛼𝑜 ∙ ∆𝑇) 

Moreover, this would increase the current level which in turn would increase the power 
consumption following the equation given below: 

𝑃 =  𝑈𝑐 ∙ 𝐼 =  𝐼2 ∙ 𝑅 

Hence, copper is chosen as the desired material. 

3.7.8.5 Coil Properties: 

The properties for copper is given below: 

Table 28 Material Properties 

 

The current flowing through a coil with resistance R is given by: 

𝑉𝑠 𝑉𝑠 ∙ 𝑎𝑤
𝑖 =  =   

𝑅 𝑁 ∙ 𝐶 ∙ 𝜎
The magnetic moment generated by such a coil with turns N, cross sectional area A, and current 𝑖 
is given by- 

𝑚 = 𝑁 ∙ 𝑖 ∙ 𝐴 

The generated magnetic moment should be greater than the required magnetic moment to 
counteract the disturbance torques. Hence 

𝑉𝑠 ∙ 𝑎𝑤 ∙ 𝐴
𝑁 ∙ 𝑖 ∙ 𝐴 =  ≥ 𝑚 

𝐶 ∙ 𝜎
This gives the minimum area required for the coil by rearranging the terms as below:  

𝑚 ∙ 𝐶 ∙ 𝜎
𝑎𝑤 ≥  

𝑉𝑠 ∙ 𝐴

But the supply voltage VS is ~5V. The specific resistivity at 15o C is 1.55×10-8. The operational 
temperature range is 40 degrees to 80 degrees. The dimension of the torquers is assumed to be 
~0.0955cm ×0.0955cm for the 10 cm × 10 cm side and ~0.0955cm ×0.2955cm for the 30 cm ×10 
cm side. The minimum cross sectional area for the coil wire can be obtained as: 

123 
 



0.28426 × (4 × 0.0955) × 1.55 × 10−8 × (1 + 65 × 3.9 × 10−3
)

𝑎𝑤 ≥  
5 × 0.0955 × 0.0955

(Minimum cross section area obtained at 80 degrees. ) 

= 4.626×10-8 (for 10 cm × 10 cm side)

3.7.8.6 Control Circuit 

 
Figure 77 General Overview of the Control Driver Circuit 

3.7.8.7 Coil Driver Circuit/ H-Bridge 

Electrically, magnetorquers can be represented as loads with considerable level of inductance. 
Although the microcontroller manages to keep providing a standard current, but it is always safer 
for avoiding direct connections to avoid sudden rise in currents or voltage peaks. Hence, for driving 
the magnetorquers, coil driver circuits are used. 

The coil driver is shown below: 

 
Figure 78 H-bridge 

The load, i.e. the magnetorquer, can either be switched on or off, with the direction of the current 
flow being determined by which diagonal pair of the H Bridge is cycled. When the magnetorquer 
is switched on, the maximum current flows; when it is off, no current flows. The H Bridge consists 
of 4 transistors. If Q1 and Q3 are turned on, then there is a positive current and negative if Q2 and 
Q4 are turned on. The coil is connected between C1, C2 and C3, C4. To avoid the power loss in 
the driver circuit, the transistors are operated in saturation region satisfying the equation below: 

𝐼𝑐
𝐼𝑏 > 𝐼𝑏 =   

𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝐻𝐹𝐸
Where 𝐼𝑏 is the current applied to the base of the transistor, 𝐼𝑐 is the collector current and HFE is 
the transistor gain. 

125 
 



3.7.8.7 Schottky Diodes 

Diodes are placed between C1, C2 and C3, C4 and the voltage supply. This is prevent the sudden 
peaks in the voltage supply from affecting the H Bridge. Exposure to such sparks for longer 
times may result in damage to the H Bridge.The figure including the Schottky diodes is shown 
below: 

 

3.7.8.8 Example Control Circuit on LT SPICE: 

The H Bridge circuit implemented on LT SPICE is shown below: 

 
Figure 79 Current Controlled H-Bridge with torquer load and inductance 

3.7.8.9 Current Sensing 

Current sensing circuit is employed by adding small resistors in series with the coils. The resistance 
of these are chosen to be about 1000 times smaller than the minimum coil resistance. A simple 
current sensing circuit using an Operational Amplifier is shown below: 

126 
 



 
Figure 80 Current Sensor Circuit 

The equations employed are given below: 

𝑅1 + 𝑅2 𝑅4 𝑅2 𝑅1 + 𝑅2 𝑅3 𝑉
𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡 =  ( ) − + ( )  

𝑅3 + 𝑅4 𝑅1 𝑅1 𝑅3 + 𝑅4 𝑅1 2

𝑏𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑅1 =  𝑅3𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑅2 =  𝑅4 

𝑅2 𝑉
𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡 =  (𝑉 ) +  

𝑅 2 − 𝑉1
1 2

This gives us an output voltage which can be used to determine the small voltage difference (V2 – 
V1) and thus determine the current through the resistor. 

However, the reference (offset) voltage of 2.5V (V/2) is maintained as discussed in the reference 
voltage circuit next. 

3.7.8.10 Reference Voltage Circuit 

Since the microcontroller needs the Vout values to lie between 0 to 5V in the current sensing circuit, 
a reference voltage of 2.5V is needed. This is done using voltage reference. 

The voltage reference to be used is LT6654-2.5 which has an operating temperature range of -50o 
C to 125o C and a storage temperature range of -65oC to 150o C. It has an output accuracy of 
0.05-0.1%. The circuit block diagram as given in the data-sheet is given below: 

 

127 
 



 
Figure 81 Reference Voltage Circuit Diagram 

 
Figure 82 Circuit Diagram 

The input bypass capacitor of minimum value 0.1μF is necessary for preventing the input voltage 
to exceed the maximum voltage rating (0.1 is calculated for the worst case condition according to 
its rating V>30V). The 1μF load capacitor is for avoiding sharp increases in voltage values. The 
significance of the load and bypass capacitors is shown in the analysis below: 

 
Figure 83 Turn-on characteristics of LT6654-2.5 

128 
 



 
Figure 84 Voltage variation if input has a ripple of 0.5V 

3.7.8.11 Modeling of Coil Inductance and Resistance 

The inductance and the resistance of the coils is modelled using the following equations: 

 

𝑅 =  (𝑙 ∗ 𝜌)/𝑎 

Where W represents the width of the loop and h the height, and other parameters with their usual 
representations. The calculated values come out to be: 

 

Inductance 

10 cm x 10 cm face 0.0844 H 

30 cm x 10 cm face 0.0222 H 

 

Resistance along with values at temperature end points 

10 cm x 10 cm face 54.58791Ω (41.814Ω ,67.3615Ω) 

30 cm x 10 cm face 64.49Ω (49.4Ω ,79.6Ω) 

129 
 



 

This inductive effect affects the voltage variation across the coils. It also gives rise to residual 
magnetism in the coil. This may affect the magnetometer readings and needs to be taken care of. 
This can be best accomplished by modelling the resistance and the inductance values and 
determining the time constant so as to fix the time interval before taking the magnetometer 
readings.  

To calculate this time interval, assume supply voltage to be 5V (the voltage across resistance may 
also vary due to the inductance, but this effect is quite negligible if calculated at t=~1s, the time 
for which the torquers remain on). After t = ~1s, the voltage across resistance is at ~5V. Now when 
suddenly it is turned off, a voltage of 5V is generated across the inductor. The model and the time 
domain representation of the transients is shown below:  

The coil can be assumed to 
be a resistance and an 

inductor in series 

 
𝑅𝑡

𝑉𝑂 = 5 × 𝑒−
𝐿  is the voltage across the inductor. 

 

 

The transient time of a RL circuit is given by ~5 times the time constant, or 5×L/R. Hence this 
time interval that is required for B Dot cycle is given by ~ 5×L/R.

3.7.8.12 Implementation in LTSpice 

The following circuit shows the implementation of the control driver along with the control 
circuit in LTSpice. The magnetorquer is modelled as a resistor and an inductor in series for 
single face of the satellite. The current switching waveforms are shown below: 

 
Figure 85 SPICE Circuit Model 

 
Figure 86 Current simulation results after addition of smoothing capacitor 

3.7.8.13 Hardware Design Specifications 

The first decision taken is the placement of the torquers in the satellite body. Placing the torquers 
internal to the satellite body is preferred because of the following factors: 

 Maximum area would be available for the solar panels. If the torquers are placed externally, then 
some part of the face area is occupied by the torquers. 

 Placing the torquers externally adds to the vulnerability of the torquers to radiations in space. 
Placing the torquers externally also makes it physically safer. 

The Coil Winder: 

The major components of the coil winder setup includes:  

 The coil reel - A rectangular reel of the required dimensions is fabricated in plastic. 
Generally a Teflon reel is preferred, where the two outer layers are made using plastic and 
the inner three layers are made of Teflon. All the three layers are first assembled together 
using screws and then disassembled when the coil is ready to be removed. The inner layers 
are made of Teflon due to its low-friction property. This property helps the removal of the 
reel from the adhesive used to coil the wires together. It can used multiple number of times 

131 
 



as the final reel consists of the coiled wires and adhesive. Sometimes, the 3D-printed reel 
is preferred. It is similar to the Teflon reel except the facts that the inner layer consists of 
3-D printed plastic instead of Teflon and the inner plastic layer remains attached to the 
coiled wires and adhesive in the final torquer that is fabricated. Its advantage is that the 
plastic layer provides physical strength to the coil. But this model is sometimes not 
preferred as multiple reels have to be made for fabrication of multiple coils. 

 Mechanical components like the wire brake, metal shafts and Teflon bearings. 
 A DC motor controlled by a potentiometer. 
 The coil winder card 
 Guiding wheel and Servo. 

 

3.7.9 Lead time for procurement of sensors 

The sensors and actuators that will be purchased for the subsystem are listed along with the 
provider’s details. Currently, the team is in contact with the companies and is planning to procure 
them by the end of the academic year 2016-17. Wherever needed, a redundant pair will be procured 
along with the sensors that will go with the satellite to take care of any problems that may arise 
during testing.  

For the prototype phase(August 2016 - December 2016), a replica of the ADCS subsystem will be 
designed using low cost sensors and actuators that have similar specifications as the original ones. 
The testing and calibration modules will be developed for prototype phase as well. Hence, they 
will be used for final sensors along with the required modifications.

3.8 Communication subsystem 

The communication subsystem establishes the connection between the satellite and the ground 
station, and is the only means of knowing the status of the satellite and communicating with it. 
The primary functions of the communication system are - transmission of a tracking signal, 
transmission of the payload and housekeeping data, and the reception of data/commands from 
the ground station. Being a power hungry system, the communication subsystem presents a 
major limiting factor for a nanosatellite. 

3.8.1 Subsystem requirements 

3.8.1.1 Structure 

 The communication board should be placed away from the magnetorquers to reduce RF 
interference.  

 The antennas are wound by a Nichrome wire before launch and are released post launch 
by heating the Nichrome wire. 

3.8.1.2 Power 

 Power required for the beacon - 0.5W. 
 Power required for data transmission for a maximum duration of 10 minutes - 3W 

(approx.). 
3.8.1.3 OBC 

 The payload data has to be supplied by the OBC MCU following AX.25 protocol. 
 The beacon data has to be Morse coded by the MCU.  
 The received commands are decoded by the OBC MCU. 
 The MCU controls the various modes of operation of the transceiver module. 

3.8.1.5 ADCS 

 Appropriate stabilization should be achieved by the ADCS to reduce pointing loss during 
data transmission. 

3.8.2 Subsystem specifications 

 Power consumption: Nanosatellites have strict power constraints. The telemetry 
subsystem being one of the power hungry subsystems, it is essential that the system 
parameters are chosen so as to reduce the power consumption without compromising 
much on the data transmission/reception fidelity. Keeping this in mind, the maximum 
power allocated to the two communication systems on board – beacon and the one for 
payload data transmission – is 3-4 W, during data transmission.  

 Operating frequency: Data rate has to be traded off with bandwidth required and noise. 
While deciding upon the data rate one has to keep in mind the Doppler shift that occurs 
due to orbital velocity of the satellite, which in turn affects the bandwidth of operation.  
Speed of rotation of satellite vs = 7.557 km/sec 
The component of the speed in the direction of the ground station  
vr = vs × Re/ (Re + Rh) 

 Where Re = radius of earth and Rh = altitude of the satellite = 600 km 
 Hence, vr = 6.907km/sec 
 The Doppler shift is given by Δf = ft × vr/c 
 Where ft = transmission frequency and c = speed of light 

133 
 



The international regulation requires that the bandwidth should include the data signal 
bandwidth (Bsig) along with two times the Doppler shift (Δf) [40]. 

  B = 2Δf + Bsig 
  Bsig ≤ Bmax - 2Δf 

Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) operation, as stated by the Ministry of Communications and 
Information Technology, India, requires that Bmax = 30 kHz and the operating frequency 
be 434-438 MHz. Very High Frequency (VHF) has an operating frequency range of 144-
146 MHz with Bmax = 18 kH. [41] 
Now, the data rate depends on the modulation scheme chosen and the link budget. The 
latter has not been evaluated yet.    

 Modulation scheme: It depends on factors like: 
 Bit error probability 
 Inter-symbol interference 
 Transmission power 
 Bandwidth 
 Circuit complexity 

For nanosatellite communication, generally FSK or PSK (and their special cases) 
modulation techniques are used. While PSK is more bandwidth efficient (can transmit 
more number of bits in a given bandwidth) when compared to FSK, it does so at the 
expense of power efficiency. Also, FSK has better noise rejection for the same data rate 
and has a simpler implementation than PSK. Hence, we will be using some form of FSK. 

Figure 87 Comparison of FSK and BPSK 
MSK is a special type of FSK which has a continuous phase, as compared to a normal 
FSK which has discontinuities 
when switching between the 
"mark" and "space" 
frequencies, producing 
wideband frequency 
components. Due to this, it has 
a better spectral efficiency than 
a standard FSK and has lower 
sideband power. Applying a 
Gaussian low pass filter to 
MSK further lowers the Figure 88 Bandwidth comparison of MSK and GMSK. Courtesy -

other frequency bands as can be seen in the above figure. Hence, we have opted to use 
the GMSK modulation technique. 

 AX.25 protocol: The AX.25 protocol, based on the X.25 protocol, is designed for radio 
amateur usage. The protocol is designed to accept and deliver data over a variety of types 
of communication links, for reliable transmission. The protocol uses a CRC-l6 error 
check of each data packet and frame check sequences to guard against receiving data 
frames out of order when multiple packets are received. AX.25 is a highly structured, 
positive acknowledgment protocol using advanced algorithms to insure that data 
exchanged between two modems is correct. Due to the large amateur ham radio user 
community, it is well documented. The following figure shows the information frame 
format. 

Figure 89 AX.25 information frame format [104] 
The payload and housekeeping data will be sent using the above format. 

3.8.3 System architecture 

The payload data will be encoded into AX.25 packets and sent to the transceiver module. Given 
below is the block diagram for the data transmission part of the telemetry subsystem. 

Figure 90 System architecture of the data transmission part 
 

The RF module - AX.100 transceiver by GOMspace and antenna by ISIS - will be procured for 
the satellite. For the ground station the transceiver is now chosen as Kenwood TS-2000, instead of 
ICOM-910h, as the former is available with the institute. This shift in the transceiver is possible 
without any major change in the overall design of the ground station. 

3.8.3.1 Microcontroller Unit: 

The MCU that will be used in our system will be ARM Cortex-A9, a part of the OBC. It is 
responsible for collecting the housekeeping data and the compressed hyperspectral image, and 
sending it to the transceiver (AX-100). It is also responsible for receiving and decoding the 
data/commands sent from the transceiver. The MCU is interfaced with the AX100 using I2C 
interface.  

135 
 



3.8.3.2 Transceiver module: 

The transceiver is an essential part of the communication system. It is responsible for receiving 
and transmitting the signal. The MCU must configure the transceiver before any transmission or 
reception. Transceivers working in the ultra-high frequency range were compared based on 
certain features like power consumption, modulation schemes, gain, etc. The power consumption 
constraint is of the highest priority due to other power hungry modules on board - ADCS, FPGA 
and Hyperspectral Camera. The following table has been compiled for an easy comparison.  

Table 30 Comparison of Transceiver Modules

(Rx) 
Keeping only the power constraint in mind, it appears that CC1101 transceiver works remarkably 
in terms of power consumption. But, a power amplifier for transmission and an RF switch need 
to be connected externally to CC1101. The advantage with AX100 and U248C (both 
manufactured by GomSpace), which are made especially for space use, is that these components 
are built into the module. This greatly simplifies the system design, while also giving an 
advantage in terms of power consumption. But, U248C has an unnecessary (as far as our design 
is concerned) housekeeping capabilities and has a maximum power consumption of 5W.  AX100 
has a typical power consumption of 2.69W, with an output power of 1W. If this is not sufficient 
an external RF power amplifier can be added. Hence, this transceiver is chosen, while keeping 
U248C still under consideration. The final decision will be made while testing on hardware for 
the preliminary design review.  
Some of the important specifications of the transceiver are given below.

As discussed earlier, GMSK modulation scheme will be used as of now. At a later point of time, 
upon further research and testing, if we realize that either MSK, FSK or GFSK will be more 
suitable for our purpose, we may easily configure the AX100 to implement the required 
modulation scheme. Also, this transceiver allows in-orbit reconfiguration of frequency, bitrate, 
filter-bandwidth, and modulation type. 

3.8.4 Beacon 

The block diagram for the beacon system is shown below: 

Figure 95 Beacon system architecture 

3.8.4.1 Microcontroller Unit: 

The MCU is responsible for encoding the data to be sent in the form of Morse code using CW 
(Continuous Wave) modulation technique. This does not require complicated receivers for 
decoding the transmitted signal and also uses less RF transmission power. This is achieved at the 
cost of a low data rate. 

3.8.4.2 OOK/ASK modulator:  

A simple transmitter is required for the beacon transmission as compared to a complicated 
transceiver as used for the data transmission circuit. For this purpose, RF2516 is used which can 
implement an Amplitude Shift Keying/ On-Off Keying (ASK/OOK). It has low power and 
power down capabilities. Another modulator transmitting in the VHF frequencies - CYTD1 by 
CY Wireless Technology Limited - was considered. It gave a higher output power of 28dB at the 
cost of higher power consumption of around 600mW, as compared to the 30mW power 
consumption of RF2516. Hence, RF2516 was selected owing to the stringent power budget. 
Some of the important specifications are given below. The modulator provides a few control 
lines for controlling the operation of the modulator IC.  

Figure 96 Modulator specifications [124] 

138 
 



3.8.4.3 Power amplifier: 

The power amplifier is used to boost the signal transmit power. This amplifier consists of an RF 
amplifier IC that will be tuned to provide sufficient signal gain. The RF power amplifier chosen 
for this purpose is THS9001 by Texas Instruments. It can provide more than 20dB of gain, while 
consuming around 330 mW of power working at a supply of 2.7V to 5V. It works in a frequency 
range of 50MHz to 750MHz. Another power amplifier, RFPA0133 was also considered but was 
rejected as it consumed higher power. If the output power is not sufficient, another THS9001 can 
be cascaded.   

3.8.5 Beacon Downlink 

The signal sent by the beacon makes it possible to locate the satellite and know its status. This 
enables the receiver at the ground station to maintain appropriate pointing to reduce pointing 
loss. The beacon is a low data rate Morse coded signal using CW modulation to periodically 
transmit the following information: 

 Call sign 
 Text string  
 Software error count 
 Battery voltage 
 MCU temperature 
 Boot status 

When the MCU is not able to supply the above information to the beacon due to some glitch, or 
when satellite switches on (EPS is switched on) with the OBC still not switched on, a default 
message is sent indicating that the satellite is still “alive”. 

3.8.6 Data Downlink  

The compressed hyperspectral image will be stored in an on-board memory. When the satellite 
passes above the ground station and there is sufficient power available in the batteries, the MCU 
will transfer the data to the transceiver which modulates it and transmits. Along with the 
compressed image, all the housekeeping data that was logged in the on-board memory is sent in 
the same way.  

3.8.7 Data Uplink  

Two Line Elements will be regularly uplinked to the satellite which will let the satellite know its 
position. Along with this, commands will be sent to capture hyperspectral images, reconfigure 
the transceiver (change the bitrate, frequency, modulation, etc.) and the FPGA, along with 
software patches or updates. There will also be handshaking signals to establish a connection.  

3.8.8 Frequency Clearance 

Though the VHF and UHF frequencies as defined by International Telecommunication Union 
(ITU) is 30MHz-300MHz and 300MHz-3GHz, people in the nanosatellite community generally 
use the amateur satellite radio frequencies as they do not require a formal application to ITU 
[40]. The usage of VHF and UHF frequencies for amateur satellite operations is regulated by the 
Norwegian Post and Telecommunication Authority (NPT).  

3.8.9 Antenna 

Since a beacon antenna has to be continuously working it is not feasible to use a directional 
antenna for the beacon, as in that case continuous pointing has to be maintained and the power 

139 
 



budgets on nanosatellites generally do not permit that. Hence, a near omni-directional monopole 
antenna is used for the beacon. 
Directional antennas like Yagi and dish antennas provide much higher gain than omni-directional 
antennas, but they also require a high degree of pointing control since the beam width is much 
narrower than that of an omnidirectional antenna. Though the ADCS is quite capable of 
achieving such a pointing accuracy, it also requires a lot of power for the same. Hence, people 
generally use omnidirectional antennas like dipole antenna or turnstile antenna, with a trivial 
amount of pointing that is achieved using magnetorquers.  
The advantage of using a turnstile antenna is that it gives a circularly polarized signal and hence 
it is not required to orient the satellite as there is no problem of polarization mismatch loss. But 
the power consumption in this case will be more than that of a dipole antenna. If a circularly 
polarized antenna is used at the ground station, there is a maximum of 3dB loss in the link 
margin when a dipole antenna is used. Since, the link budget calculations have not been done, it 
is not possible to conclude if a reliable connection can be established in spite of the drop. Hence, 
a dipole antenna is chosen as of now, and we will switch to using a turnstile antenna if such a 
drop cannot be tolerated.  
To enable such a switch a deployable VHF/UHF antenna by ISIS is chosen. It is basically a 
crossed dipole antenna which can be configured as either a turnstile antenna or two dipoles or a 
dipole and a monopole, the last option being our choice of operation. The antenna has a 
frequency range of 130 - 150 MHz. It nominally consumes 20 mW of power at 3V [42].

3.8.11 The Ground Station 

The ground station system establishes the physical RF link between the space and ground segment. 
It controls the antenna rotors, the modem and the transceiver. The ground station will be based on 
commercial off-the-shelf components. The ground station will be built inside the campus itself. 
The antenna and rotors would be installed on the roof and the other components like modem, 
transceiver, PC, etc. would be installed in a separate room near the antenna. In the following 
proposal, a more detailed description of the ground station is given first, and then the plan of action 
is elaborated upon. 

The overall block diagram for the ground station can be found in the figure below: 

 
Figure 97 Ground Station System Overview 

 

146 
 



3.8.11.1 GS Controller PC  

The ground station PC is responsible for downloading Two Line Element (TLE) data from 
NORAD, tracking the satellite using software (Ham Radio Deluxe) and sending signals to the rotor 
through the rotor control interface. The PC also controls the frequency of the transceiver required 
for Doppler correction and takes care of transmitting and receiving data from the transceiver. Apart 
from this manual control of rotor and transceiver will also be possible through the PC. It is also 
connected to the Mission Control System.  

3.8.11.2 GMSK Modem 

The CMX7143 Multi-Mode Wireless Data Modem from CML Microcircuits has been proposed 
for implementing the GMSK modulation scheme for payload data, though it also supports GFSK, 
MSK and FSK. This will be helpful in case we decide to change the modulation scheme in future. 
The modem will be procured as a PE0401 Microcontroller CMX7143 Evaluation Kit which will 
be interfaced to a PE0003 Universal Interface Card using C-BUS which is a 4-wire, high speed 
synchronous serial command/data bus. The Universal Interface Card provides USB/serial 
connection for connection with PC.  

CMX7143 is a half-duplex modem. It supports formatted data blocks of variable length up to 18 
bytes, and 16-bit CRC support for error detection, plus hamming code.  

 
Figure 98 GMSK Modem 

3.8.11.3 Yaesu G5500 Rotor 

The Yaesu G5500 azimuth and elevation rotor has been chosen for antenna pointing. It provides 
4500 azimuth and 900 elevation control of antennas. It comes with its own controller unit with two 
meters on its front for showing azimuthal and elevation angles. It also has 4 switches for moving 

147 
 



the antenna up, down, left and right and one power switch. It comes in two variants 110 VAC and 
220 VAC, of which 220V matches with our local line voltage. The maximum safe load of the 
antenna depends upon the physical size of the antenna, method and quality of mechanical 
installation, and maximum wind velocity at installation site. All the structural requirements of the 
mast must be fulfilled as required by the rotor. The block diagram of the rotor controller can be 
seen in the figure below.  

 
Figure 99 Yaesu G5500 Rotor 

3.8.11.4 GS 232B computer control interface 

For the computer control interface of Yaesu G550 antenna rotators, we will be using GS 232B. 
The GS-232B contains its own microprocessor with a 10 bit analog-to-digital (A-D) converter and 
EEPROM. The asynchronous serial line can be configured for serial data rates from 1200 to 9600 
baud. It has a DB 9 male connector for connection to RS 232C port of computer. Firmware of GS 
232 also supports commands directly from keyboard and software made for controlling it.  It 
requires 12 V DC power supply for operation. The control cable for Az/El rotator and DC cable is 
provided with it. The following figure shows the necessary connections that are to be made.  

148 
 



 
Figure 100 GS 232B computer control interface 

3.8.11.5 Software for ground station 

The ground station software consists of software for graphical user interface that will be running 
on the ground station server and comes under the mission control system. All the details of the 
ground station hardware (transceiver, rotor, etc.) are controlled through the ground station 
application. It also automatically receives the telemetry data from the satellite when it comes in 
contact with the ground station. It also schedules the tasks and tele-commands for sending them to 
the satellite. A logbook of all the events is also maintained. 

Ham Radio Deluxe (HRD) has been chosen as the software for ground station due to its 
driver/equipment support for our radio and rotor. This software uses Two Line Elements (TLEs) 
for tracking the satellite and uses it to control the radio and the rotor. TLEs are regularly updated 
through internet and the software shows the details of the satellite being tracked graphically to 
the user. It calculates the azimuth and elevation angles of the satellite with respect to the ground 
station whose location is being fed to the software and sends it to the rotor for pointing the 
antennae. It also calculates the Doppler shift in the frequency of the radio from the velocity of 
the satellite.

  3.8.12 Antenna System 

 

Both the sequence controllers and the transceiver are connected to the Power Supply Unit. A 
lightning protector may be connected between the power splitter of antennae and the pre-amplifier. 
The polarization switch is interfaced between the power splitters of antenna array and the pre-
amplifiers for excitation of the antenna and receiving and transmitting the desired signal. 

Within the antenna (a crossed Yagi pair), the signal travels from the power splitters, switched 
using a polarization switch and then it goes to the preamplifier. The sequence controller ensures 
the proper sequencing of the transceiver and pre-amplifier switching, lest the pre-amplifier 
should be damaged. Here are some of the features of the sequence controller that is chosen for 
our purpose. 

3.8.12.1 DCW 2004 B 

● It allows a comfortable remote coupling of the SUPER-AMP preamplifiers via the coaxial 
cable as well as delayed switching of HF linear amplifiers. 

● The sequential operation of the DCW 2004 B avoids reliably any damage to the 
preamplifier that may be caused by HF-spikes during switching. It offers 3 switching 
outputs in total, which have ascending delay times /ascending latency times. These 
switching outputs can, for example, be used for activating further relays, which may be of 
help for more complex systems. 

● DCW 2004 B is designed to work with the chosen LNAs: SP-2000 and SP-7000  
● The HF-section of the DCW 2004 B offers a very low insertion loss and a high shielding 

factor. 

150 
 



After the insertion of the preamplifier as close as possible to the antenna feeding point, one end of 
the cable connected to the PC has to be connected with the preamplifier. No filters are to be inserted 
as that will hamper the direct voltage transfer to preamplifier. 

The following diagrams show the DCW 2004 B sequence controller, along with its connection to 
the preamplifiers and the antenna. The second figure also shows the timing sequence of the 
sequence controller.

3.8.13 Plan of action 

We are almost ready with hardware design of the ground station, and soon we would be working 
on the mission control system. Some of the things that we are yet to determine include the manner 
in which the data would be stored and retrieved from a database, and be made accessible to 
different people for performing different tasks. The different components to be used for 
maintaining a logbook of events/failures, reception of telemetry data and sending tele-commands, 
etc. will have to be considered. The detailed analysis of things like tasks to be performed when the 
satellite comes in contact and order in which they are to be performed is also pending. So, basically 
the work that is yet to be done is of the software part. Coming to procuring the components, the 
most important component, the transceiver, is available with the institute. We will try to acquire 
the remaining important components - LNAs, antenna and connectors - and go about with building 
the ground station for the preliminary design review.

3.9 PSLV interface 

It is proposed by the team to fabricate a 3-U Ejection system (ES) based on the specification of 
P-POD (poly picosat deployer). The ejection system supports a 3U type nanosatellite with 
dimensions specified by CALPOLY i.e. 10 cm*10 cm*34 cm with mass 3.0kg-3.5kg.  It has a 
tube design which produces a reliable linear path for a satellite with low spin rates. Satellites are 
ejected using a spring loaded mechanism on Teflon impregnated hard anodized rails. These rails 
are resilient to cold welding due to the prolonged contact under low pressure conditions. After 
the ejection system successfully ejects itself from the launch vehicle, the electric signal initiates 
the opening of spring loaded doors and the spring loaded mechanism plunges the satellite out. A 
safety latch should be integrated to avoid the recoiling of a door once it has been opened. 

Table 34 Mechanical Configurations of the considered ejection systems 

Mechanical Configurations 
 Mass(Kg) Dimensions(m) Mass of satellite(Kg) 

COD01-3U  4.3 0.43*0.17*0.21 ~ 3 
ES 
P-POD 2.0 0.41*0.16*0.12 ~ 3 

 

3.9.1 Justification for 3-U satellite  

3U is most suitable among the other choices such as 2U, 1U and 27U and it has been decided to 
stick to the current design due to the following reasons: 

1. It closely packs all the equipment from each subsystem with optimum accessibility, thus it 
is more mass and space efficient. Other choices such as 27U will be highly inefficient in 
terms of space and mass for this mission. 

2. 2U and 1U will have very less surface area so they will not be able to meet high demands 
of power requirement. 

 
3.9.2 Description of Ejection System 

3.9.2.1 Overview 

The ejection system (hereby referred to as 'The Deployer') designed for Anant nanosatellite is a P-
POD type [51], tubular, spring-release mechanism equipped Cubesat dispenser. The Deployer is 
compatible with Calpoly Cubesat standards and can be used to eject any combination of 3-U 
Cubesats. Its primary functions are: 

 To protect the launch vehicle and primary payload(s) 
 To provide a safe and reliable deployment system for Cubesats 
 To create interface between the Cubesat(s) and the Launch Vehicle. 

 

154 
 



 
Figure 104 A rendered model of The Deployer 

 
Figure 105 Axis Definition 

3.9.2.2 Working Mechanism 

The Deployer has 8 smooth guide rails which fix the path of the Cubesat(s) during ejection and 
minimize tumbling rates. A door is locked using a Release mechanism, which swings open upon 
receiving an electrical signal. The satellite is ejected as it is pushed by a pusher plate, which is 
loaded with a helical main spring and four spring plungers ('kick springs'). The door swings open 
to a maximum of 90 degrees (which is adjustable on-the go), and is stopped by a latching 
mechanism to prevent rebound and collision with the ejecting satellite(s). The door is also 
equipped with two 'soft' door rails to prevent chattering of satellite(s) along long axis. They also 
provide vibration isolation and damping along the same axis. Encapsulation of the Cubesat(s) in 
the Deployer mechanically and electrically isolates the Cubesat(s) from the rest of the launch 
vehicle. Designing the Deployer to act as a faraday cage provides EMI protection. The Panels are 
electrically connected to help block accidental transmissions produced by Cubesats. 

155 
 



 
Figure 106 Exploded view of The Deployer 

3.9.2.3 Guide rails and Panels 

The panels, door and guide rails of the Deployer are machined from Aluminum 6061-T6, the same 
material as that of the Cubesat structure. This material is recommended by Calpoly and has similar 
thermal and mechanical properties as the standard Cubesats to ensure compatibility. The Guide 
rails and surfaces are hard anodised with roughness <1.6 um. Coatings like Teflon may be used 
for reducing friction. The inner surface of the panels is flat and smooth to prevent jamming in case 
of any accidental deployment of Cubesat deployables. 

 
Figure 107 Top and Side panels 

156 
 



 
Figure 108 Access Ports 

The top (+Y) and side (+X) panels also have access ports for accessing umbilical connector ports 
of the satellite(s) and aiding in installation prior to storage. The port on the side panel will be useful 
in checking the proper integration and adjustment of the kick springs. 

3.9.2.4 Release Mechanism 

The Release mechanism is responsible for 

 Initiating deployment of the Cubesats upon receipt of a separation signal. 
 Preventing the deployment of Cubesats until a separation signal is received. 

The proposed release mechanism in the Deployer uses a rotating claw which is hinged and 
loaded using a torsion spring. A Pin puller holds the claw in place, thus constricting the door. 
Upon activation, the pin puller releases the claw which then releases the door. 

 

 
Figure 109 Open Configuration 

157 
 



 
Figure 110 Closed Configuration 

A claw is used for restricting the door to relieve the pin puller of (shear) stress. Most of the force 
from the loaded door is borne by the claw hinge and clevis bracket, thus relieving the pin puller 
(Figure 8). A slot is cut in the claw-pin interface to ensure this. The load on each component can 
be modified and distributed using different length of hook and adjusting pin position. Using this 
configuration, cheaper actuators can be used- in this case, a pin puller with lower specifications. 
Other mechanisms can also be incorporated in this design (cable cutter, separation nuts etc.) 
instead of pin the puller and might be considered in later stages. Further studies are being 
undertaken to explore other release mechanisms. The final decision would after testing and 
consultation with Tech support of the respective commercial actuator. 

 
Figure 111 Release Mechanism 

3.9.2.5 Door 

The door is designed to be lightweight and stiff to enable proper functioning. It is hinged to the 
Deployer and loaded with torsion springs, door rails and latching bracket. The door should swing 
open fast enough to not interfere with the ejecting satellite(s). 

3.9.2.6 Latching Mechanism 

A bracket, machined from Delrin is fixed to the rear end of the door, which is received by a stopper. 
Delrin is chosen (for other components also) due to its light weight, strength, temperature 
resistance and shock-absorbing properties. It is a commercial Polyoxymethylene homopolymer 
with a history of application in Cubesats. The stopper can be made of rubber or similar viscoelastic 
material. Both the bracket and the stopper have Hook and Loops Velcro adhered to the surface. 
This creates the latching action and prevents rebound of the door. The orientation and position of 
the smooth door rails minimize any accident in case of failure of latching mechanism. A range of 
other latching mechanisms can be integrated alongside for redundancy.

3.9.2.7 Door Rails 

Two door rails are fixed to the inner surface of the door. The rails are machined from Delrin and 
adhered to strips made of viscoelastic materials. Sorbothane is a material of choice; however a 
wide range of foams and elastomers can be utilized for the purpose. Due to gaps between satellite 
and its interior surroundings, the satellite is not fully constrained and rattles inside the Deployer. 
This results in unwanted shocks and vibration analysis of Cubesats inside Deployers becomes very 
difficult. This requires developers to add margin to their failure analysis or avoid complex 
subsystems altogether. High, unpredictable vibration loads discourage development of advanced 
Cubesat systems. The door rails will prevent chattering, provide damping and vibration isolation 
by creating constraints to the satellite inside the Deployer along the z axis. This will help in 
reducing loads and create a modellable configuration during vibration analysis. An area of research 
is viscoelastic material integrated guide rails to provide isolation and damping along all the axes, 
and might be considered in later stages following prototype testing. [52]

3.9.2.8 Pusher Plate 

The pusher plate forces the satellite out of the Deployer with the help of main and kick springs. 
The dimension of the plate adheres to the latest Cubesat design specification regarding cylindrical 
extension to the satellite. 

 
Figure 115 Pusher Plate 

3.9.2.9 Main Spring 

The main spring is a coiled helical type spring which provides the major force to eject the 
satellite(s). Initially a conical spring was chosen to reduce the minimum length, but such a spring 
interfered with the latest dimensional constraints fixed by Calpoly (cylindrical extension). To 
ensure maximum compatibility with all Cubesats, a cylindrical spring is chosen with appropriate 
dimensions of the pusher plate. The spring rate of the main, kicker and hinge springs can be 
determined from mission requirements and trajectory of launch vehicle. 

3.9.2.10 Kick Spring 

The kick springs are short throw, high stiffness springs which provide an additional force which 
may help start the ejection process if any binding or interference occurs during launch. The kick 
springs are not preloaded, because they are not designed to act as structural members. Four 
spring plungers are screwed in the holes at the base plate. The extent of the plungers can be 

160 
 



adjusted and fixed. They allow the integration team to adjust the inner envelope of the Deployer 
to account for Cubesat rail length tolerances

3.9.2.11 Deployment Sensor 

Sensor(s) to indicate successful deployment and other events (like swinging of door) can be 
integrated in one of the many accessible positions with minimum modification of other 
components. A tactile microswitch is preferred for simplicity. The location of the sensor can be 
finalized after subsequent revisions of design. A proposed location of a limit micro bump switch 
can be in the inner envelop, where it is actuated by the pusher plate once it (pusher plate) travels a 
specific distance. 

3.9.3 Electrical Interface 

The actuator to be used (pin puller, but true for other previously considered mechanisms) is 
activated by a short electrical pulse and do not need constant power to be supplied during any state. 

161 
 



The nature of the pulse is flexible and may be supported by the Launch Vehicle. In case it is not, 
a portable electrical unit has to be integrated with the Deployer. 

 
Figure 118 Actuation time vs. Actuation current of NEA Model 1120 Pin Puller [53] 

Another component which requires electrical interface is the deployment sensor. The switch, being 
a standard circuit (dis)connector can be integrated with the Launch Vehicle to access its telemetry 
features. 

3.9.4 Mechanical Interface 

The mechanical interface between the secondary payload and launch vehicle equipment bay deck 
will depend on the adapter used and can be finalized after consultation with launch provider. Both 
panels of -Y and -X can be utilized for this purpose. The interface between payload and deployer 
is according to standard Cubesat specifications. 

 
Figure 119 Maximum allowable payload envelope 

3.9.5 Environmental requirements 

Environmental design and testing loads will be derived from Launch Vehicle requirements. The 
primary goal is to design the Deployer to be compatible with variety of launch vehicles. 

162 
 



 Static Loads 

The Deployer is subjected to static loads caused by launch vehicle acceleration. These loads are 
based on the acceleration properties and trajectory of the launch vehicle. 

 Dynamic Loads 

Dynamic loads are produced by vibration, shocks and acoustic stimuli. 

 Thermal Loads 

The Deployer will be exposed to thermal loads produced by aero-drag and solar radiation. 
Dominant thermal loads are predicted to be transferred via conduction through any mounting 
adapter and radiation from the fairing 

 Other 

Other considerations are Pressure variation, In-flight launch Vehicle events, EMI, Humidity, 
Transportation etc. Final test and analysis model can be created after consultation with Launch 
service provider and a survey of launch and transportation environment. 

 

3.9.6 Fabrication 

The primary material of the Deployer is Aluminum 6061-T6. The panel-design allows for easy 
fabrication and assembly, as compared to, say, a monocoque model. Each component is designed 
keeping machinability in mind. Aluminum is very compliant to machining. For most purposes 
milling and drilling operations would be sufficient. Threaded inserts are used wherever possible 
as opposed to tapping for easy replacement and maintenance. Any standard CNC facility is 
expected to fulfill our manufacturing requirements. The rails and surfaces shall also be smooth 
(<1.6 um) and hard anodized with specified thickness. Other materials used in the design are Delrin 
and rubber/foam. Delrin too, is easily machinable, and compatible with standard machining 
operations. Rubber and foams can be machined with die/water jet/laser cutting process. Our design 
does not impose strict tolerance constraints on the said plastic and rubber parts and cheaper 
methods can be explored. 

Adhering Delrin and rubber to similar/dissimilar materials require special adhesives. These 
adhesives are available in space-qualified low outgassing standards. Many of these adhesives 
discard the need for special surface treatments and are favorable for our purposes. 

Velcro used in latching mechanism is available commercially in space-qualified standards. Brands 
like Nomex are NASA approved. A thermal bakeout procedure may be used to release volatile 
substances naturally found in most materials prior to integration of hardware onto the launch 
vehicle. 

3.9.7 Testing and Qualification 

To predict the behavior and qualify for the above environment requirements, the following test are 
planned to be performed. Every test will be accompanied with/followed by functional testing and 
general inspection. Our university houses none of the relevant test facilities and presently we lack 
access to any. 

 

163 
 



 Vibration Test 

The main objective in this part of the testing is to compare real world natural frequency data with 
theoretical values obtained during Finite element analysis. Random Vibration profile defined by 
Launch provider will be used to simulate launch environments. Also Sine sweep tests are very 
useful in identifying natural frequencies and amplification factors at those frequencies. Since the 
Deployer is designed to be compatible with many launch vehicles, additional testing should 
performed to ensure that the Deployer could survive the harsher launch environments of a wide 
variety of launch vehicles. The worst-case random vibration profiles outlined in the NASA GEVS 
document may be referred for this purpose. 

 Thermal Vacuum Test 

The main objectives are to ensure functionality of the mechanism in vacuum and in cold 
temperatures and check outgassing properties of Deployer materials. 

 Launch vehicle qualification 

Test procedures presented by launch provider will be performed along with the proposed tests. 
These tests are usually designed to simulate launch conditions and are specific to each vehicle. 

 Integration Test 

An integration of primary payload, Deployer and launch vehicle will be necessary to 

o Ensure compatibility between payload, Deployer and LVI mechanical interfaces. 
o Test compatibility of Deployer electrical systems with the LV computer.

4 Manpower & Organization 
The entire team is divided into seven subsystems, with each subsystem headed by a 3rd year 
student. Each subsystem team then has work divided mode wise amongst the various members, 
this kind of work division improves the learning of the team and encourages sharing of the 
knowledge gained. It also enables multi-disciplinary work to happen more easily which is 
required in a project like this. Hence, the team is divided in two ways - one, people from the 
same subsystem working on different modes and another, people from different subsystems, 
working together to ensure the functioning between different modes. 

The overall student coordinator is Parth Garg (4th year) and the overall faculty coordinator is Dr. 
Kaushar Vaidya. She is an Assistant Professor belonging to the Physics Department, BITS 
Pilani. The rest of the student team and faculty panel can be seen in tables 29 and 30.

5 Project Management Plan & Review Mechanism 

5.1 Executive Committee: 

 The subsystem leads, along with the student coordinator and system engineer, constitute the 
executive committee of the team.  

 The executive committee is responsible for tracking each subsystem’s progress through 
weekly meetings and deciding their future course of action.  

 It also serves as a medium for information exchange between subsystems.  

5.2 Advisory Board: 

 The advisory board comprises of faculty mentors of each subsystem and 4th year students who 
have previously worked in the team.  

 The advisory board serves the purpose of guiding the students in their work and making sure 
that they do not deviate from the required path.  

166 
 



5.3 Review Process: 

 Each subsystem lead schedules at least two meetings every week wherein each member’s work 
is scrutinized by other subsystem members.  

 The proceedings of each meet are documented and stored for referral purposes in future.  
 A similar procedure is followed in the weekly executive committee meetings.  
 The system engineer and the student coordinator have the decisive say in case of a deadlock 

between two subsystems over some requirement.  
 Every subsystem also presents its work to the faculty mentors twice a month. These sessions 

with the faculty are also utilized for clearing the conceptual doubts. 
 A monthly report is also submitted to the advisory board through hard copies.  
 At the end of the academic year, the next executive committee is nominated on the basis of 

previous performances of the students of each subsystem. 
 It is expected that decisions made regarding the team will trickle down to all members by the 

respective team leads and all internal decisions will be informed to the other team leads and 
the system engineer by the respective team lead. 

 The recruitment of new members is undertaken by a winter/summer programme where 
interested students are given exposure to the project by providing them with detailed reading 
material, preparing them for a research intensive project like this. Though, recruitment is kept 
open to students of all years, first and second years are selected more often in order to ensure 
continuity of the project.

9 Data Processing and Utilization Plan 
Remote sensing involves data acquisition and data processing. The diagram below shows the 
flow of processing from data acquisition to the processed product: 

Figure 120 Data utilization plan 
After data acquisition, the image is preprocessed which involves the removal of radiometric and 
geometric errors. 

Radiometric error: It includes the error due to the atmosphere between the target element and 
the sensor. This error can be caused due to humidity, temperature of atmosphere, visibility and 
pressure. The algorithms MODTRAN and 6S [52] can be used to remove the error caused by 
atmospheric conditions. These algorithms use ancillary data that can be measured in the field. 
There also exist image based methods, for example, dark targets or flat fields which can be used 
to estimate the atmospherically scattered radiance within the image. 

Geometric distortion: It is of two types, one caused due to the attitude variation of the platform 
on which the camera is mounted or topographic elevation of surface. The other is due to the 
optical aberration of the sensor. 

170 
 



To remove the error due to the topographical elevation, geometric rectification is used, in which 
the image elements are projected in their proper plane (x and y) positions. For each image pixel 
the scanning geometry is reconstructed using position, attitude, and terrain elevation angle to 
remove the terrain elevation error.  PARGE and RECTIFY [52] are the algorithms that can be 
used for removing errors due to the attitude of satellite. 
After preprocessing, the data goes for feature extraction (waveband selection is a special case of 
feature extraction). The feature extraction process is cumbersome as we have a wide range of 
wavelengths available for imaging, but not all the spectral bands can be processed as it is tough 
to process such a large amount of data. Hence, it is required to breakdown this range of 
wavelengths into a wave band such that our processing becomes efficient. Of the N number of 
bands available M bands are selected. After selection, the performance of the selected bands is 
analyzed and the best M bands are selected for processing the data. There are different ways of 
selecting M bands, of which two are given below: 
● Randomized Algorithm: It selects the features randomly and analyzes the quality of data it 

provides. 
● Sequential Algorithm: It selects M bands at a time and then replaces the worst band with the 

(M+1) th band. This process is performed iteratively, until the best M have been found. 
 
After the useful wavebands have been selected (feature extraction) the image is passed through 
classifiers. Classifiers basically classify the wavebands into various categories on the basis of 
similar properties of a data set. Non-overlapping wavebands possessing similar properties are 
grouped together. Hence, a thematic map of the features possessed by the image are drawn out 
by the classifier.  
After the classifier stage the data needs to be validated to know the accuracy. A larger dataset 
means higher efficiency of the classifier, hence, feature extraction is important. After the data 
has been validated it is ready to be used. A common workflow in hyperspectral data analysis is to 
compare spectra derived from the image data to those collected in the field or laboratory. This 
lets you quickly compare image spectra to the spectra of known materials. Absorption and 
reflectance features are easy to compare when the spectra are plotted in the same window. 
Depending upon the data set, it is processed up to different levels as shown below: 
 

Table 40 Levels of data processing [52] 

Level 0 Raw image data (digital numbers) 

Level 1A Raw image data at full resolution , radiometric and geometric calibration 
coefficients are included(*requires GPS data) but no correction applied 

Level 1B Radiometric and geometric correction (*requires GPS data) are applied. 

Level 1C Includes in-situ measurements 

Level  2 Geometric and atmospheric corrected data. 

Level 3 User end product. 

 
Data utilization depends upon the image specification acquired by the payload, given below are 
the image specifications of our payload: 

171 
 



 
·         SNR (signal to noise ratio): >50 
·         Number of wavebands: 270 (400-1000nm) 
·         Spatial resolution: 300 m 
·         Bit-depth: 12bit (increasing the radiometric resolution) 
·         Spectral resolution: 2-3nm 
·         FOV: 15.90 and (0.0250 per pixel view). 
 
Based on the other hyperspectral satellites launched and the wavebands in which the imaging 
was done, our satellites fits into the following two applications: 
 

1) Ocean Studies includes: [2] 
 Mapping surface water bodies  
 Water quality monitoring 
 Snow mapping  
 Flood mapping 
 Global land imaging   

 
The above applications are feasible because it requires low or moderate spatial resolution and the 
atmospheric window for the above application includes Visible - Near Infrared (VIS NIR). 
  
      2)  Precision Agriculture: Though our camera’s spatial resolution is not enough for it to be 
used for precision agriculture, the installment of external optics can improve the resolution to an 
extent at which it can be used for the same. Our payload’s spectral range enables us to use the 
camera for precision agriculture. With sub pixel analysis using various advanced mathematical 
methods the goal of precision agriculture can also be achieved, as was done by SPOT-4. 
 
 

10 Data dissemination plan  
Data acquired by satellite needs to be used in an appropriate way. Given below are the different 
ways in which we can disseminate our data: 

 We intend to provide access to the gathered hyperspectral data across the internet by 
storing it on a central database, which can be accessed by a remote user.  

 Data downlinked to our institute can be processed and provided in a CD-ROM disk. 
 We can downlink the raw data to hyperspectral data processing companies which can 

process and distribute them to their own customer base. 

 

11 Ground Segment Design 
Satellites launched into the Low Earth Orbit, being fairly close to earth have a short orbital time 
period of 1-2 hours. Normally a satellite pass takes a minimum of 3 minutes to a maximum of 9 
minutes [53]. Hence, it is required of the ground station to track the satellite as it traverses across 

172 
 



the sky, using the signal from the beacon and using a high power transmitter along with a 
directional antenna for data transmission.  
Owing to the low power that is generated on-board nanosatellites, the strength of the signal that 
reaches the ground station is rather small. Therefore, the signal is amplified using Low Noise 
Amplifiers (LNAs) before any kind of processing.  In addition to this, the system should account 
for the Doppler shift inflicted in the frequency of data transmission and reception. 
The goal of the ground station, is to be able to communicate with the satellite, without human 
interference. This means that the ground station should be able to receive data from the satellite, 
and send predetermined commands, and other data to the satellite. 

11.1 Uplink 

To establish a connection, it is necessary to synchronize a pre-programmed sequence number on 
the nanosatellite, with a threshold for allowing a few errors [28]. When the satellite receives the 
sequence number, it downlinks an acknowledgement. The data uplink can take place upon 
receiving the acknowledgement. If the threshold for the number of errors is breached, the 
acknowledgement is not sent by the satellite and the connection is not established. Attempts to 
establish a connection will be made at regular intervals by resending the sequence numbers, until 
an acknowledgement is received. 
After the connection is established, various commands and data may be uplinked for 
reconfiguring various modules – transceiver, FPGA and the MCU. TLE data will also be 
uplinked when required.   

11.2 Downlink 

The compressed hyperspectral image and all the housekeeping data will be downlinked by the 
satellite. As mentioned above the data transfer is always initiated by the ground station. If at any 
point during the data transfer, the connection is lost, a similar procedure as described above is 
followed to re-establish the connection and resume the data transfer.

11.3 System design 

The overall system block diagram is as shown below. 

Figure 121 Ground station system design 
 

Antenna 

The ground station is required to transmit and receive signals in two ranges of frequencies - 144-
146 MHz and 434.79-438 MHz. Hence, two antennas are required to work in the corresponding 
ranges. Due an effect called Faraday rotation, signals passing through the ionosphere suffer 
depolarization [54]. Linearly polarized antennas have to match the polarization of the incoming 
signal to reduce the loss due polarization mismatch. Also, it is very difficult to know the 
orientation of the satellite and orient the ground station antenna accordingly. Therefore, it is 
advised to use a circularly polarized antenna for the ground station. A circularly polarized 
antenna that is receiving a linear polarized signal would have a maximum of 3 dB power loss. 
This can be tolerated as in this case we know for sure that a signal will be received with some 
power. 
Yagi-Uda antennas and helical antennas are commonly used for ground stations. Yagi-Uda 
antennas are known to be more directional than helical antennas, the latter having beam widths 
of more than 900.  While using Yagi antennas, the pointing accuracy has to be traded off with 
that of helical antennas. Crossed Yagi antennas, being more efficient, will be used in our ground 
station design. Also, in helical antennas, it is not possible to change the sense of rotation of the 
circularly polarized signal. Using dish antennas is not feasible at the low frequencies at which we 
wish to operate. It is decided to use a 17 element Yagi antenna (Part Nr. – 220817) for the VHF 
band and a 19 element Yagi antenna for the UHF band (Part Nr. – 220919) [55]. 

Transceiver 

We have decided to use the NanoCom AX-100 transceiver manufactured by GOMspace on-
board the satellite. Hence the module GS100 is chosen for the ground station, which contains 
two AX100 modules. Using the same transceiver for both the ends of the link greatly simplifies 
the hardware and software development. The AX-100 on the ground station automatically takes 
care of Doppler shift tracking and will route the traffic between the PC and the satellite [44].  

Low Noise Amplifiers and preamplifiers 

An LNA has to be placed close to the antenna so that the weak incoming signal can be amplified 
before traversing the long coaxial cable to the radio. This way, the inherent loss in the stretch of 

174 
 



the cable can be ignored. The LNA will be turned off while transmitting. LNA 435 MK II for the 
UHF antenna and LNA 145 MK II for the VHF antenna will be used for the LNA. These LNAs 
are manufactured by SSB electronics.  
Preamplifiers are required for data transmission as AX-100 transceiver cannot provide enough 
output power. SP-7000 by SSB electronics will be used for this purpose. It provides a 10-20 dB 
gain.   

Rotor and rotor controller 

The Yaesu G-5500 is a widely used azimuth/elevation rotor system for the ham radio market 
[56]. Four momentary switches control the G-5500 azimuth/elevation rotor system: up, down, 
clock-wise, and counter-clock-wise. The control switches and antenna position voltages are 
available through an 8-pin external control jack on the G-5500 console. The rotor system will be 
interfaced with a computer running the NOVA satellite tracking software. 
A 12-bit ADC will be used to read the position voltages from the rotor system. An MCU will 
compare the position of the satellite sent from the NOVA software running on the computer, 
with the position of the rotor. Appropriate commands will be sent to the rotor to control it. 

Ground station software 

The ground station software is required to: 
 Store and index all of the data acquired from the satellite 
 Implement the AX.25 protocol 
 Predict the satellite’s position using TLEs from NORAD 
 Interpret the payload and housekeeping data 
 Connect to a user terminal so that a user may remotely control the ground station and 

uplink commands if required 
The software will basically cycle through various states in a finite state machine. In one such 
state, when the satellite is in view, it will try “pinging” it until contact is established. There will 
be a set of commands that will be uplinked for performing the following functions– 

 Partially reconfiguring the FPGA 
 Uploading a new flight plan 
 Requesting for the required housekeeping data 
 Reconfiguring the transceiver parameters 

The ground station server will also be equipped with the Environment for Visualizing Images 
(EnVI) software, by Exelis Visual Information Solutions, for analyzing the payload data.

Appendix B: B-dot Control Algorithm Stability Analysis 
 

The following section derives the detumbling control law starting from the main condition of 
monotonically decreasing rotational energy ‘Erot’, i.e. 

 

𝑑𝐸𝑟𝑜𝑡 𝑑 1
 = ( 𝜔𝑇 ∙ 𝐼 ∙ 𝜔 )

𝑑𝑡 𝑑𝑡 2 𝑏 𝑏 <  0   

 (1.1) 

 

Decreasing the rotational energy during detumbling means that the scalar product of the angular 
velocity and the control torque must be negative. 

𝜔𝑏 ∙ 𝑇 <   0      (1.2) 

  

The control torque ‘T’ from the magnetorquers is given by:  

𝑇 = 𝑚 × 𝐵      (1.3) 

 

(Where ‘m’ is the magnetic moment produced by the magnetorquers and ‘B’ is the magnetic field 
of the Earth.) 

Such that condition (1.2) equivalently means 

 

𝜔𝑇
𝑏 ∙ (𝑚 × 𝐵) < 0     (1.4) 

 

With the general rules for cross product manipulation 

 

     𝑎⃗𝑇 ∙ (𝑏⃗ × 𝑐)  =  𝑐𝑇 ∙ (𝑎⃗ × 𝑏⃗) 

And 

     (𝑎⃗ × 𝑏⃗) =  −(𝑏⃗ × 𝑎⃗) 

Condition (1.4) can be rewritten as  

−𝜔𝑇
𝑏 ∙ (𝐵 × 𝑚) < 0    (1.5a) 

Or  

𝑚𝑇 ∙ (𝜔𝑏 × 𝐵) < 0    (1.5b) 

 

This inequality dictates that the magnetic moment needs to have a component which is antiparallel 
to the direction of𝜔 × 𝐵. Maximum efficiency can be provided by ensuring that the entire vector 

180 
 



is anti-parallel. In other words, the inequality can be solved by expanding condition (1.5b) with a 
scalar gain C 

 

𝑚 = 𝐶 ∙ (𝜔𝑏 × 𝐵)     (1.6) 

 

for which C < 0. With the main assumption that the change of the magnetic field vector is only the 
result of the rotation of the spacecraft and not of its movement in the orbit, i.e. 

 

𝐵̇ ≅ (𝜔𝑏 × 𝐵)      (1.7) 

 

Equation (1.6) finally becomes the B-Dot detumbling Control Law: 

 

𝑚 = 𝐶 ∙ 𝐵̇      (1.8) 

 

The assumption in (1.7) implies a lower limit to the momentum dumping capability of the B-Dot 
Control Law. At the beginning of the maneuver the Geomagnetic rate of change is small as 
compared to the rotation of the spacecraft. However, the gradually decreasing rotational energy 
will eventually lead to a situation where this is no longer true and assumption (1.7) will turn 
invalid. Theoretically, the detumbling limit is achieved when the rate of rotation of the spacecraft 
equals the rate of change of the Magnetic field of the Earth. In this situation the inertial body rates 
are ≠ 0.
